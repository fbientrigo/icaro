8
00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:19,920
PROFESSOR: Thermodynamics,
all right, let's start.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:31,270
Thermodynamics is the science
of the flow of heat.

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:37,680
So, thermo is heat,
and dynamics is

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,300
the motion of heat.

12
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,730
Thermodynamics was developed
largely beginning in the

13
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:52,750
1800's, at the time of the
Industrial Revolution.

14
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,890
So, taming of steel.

15
00:00:54,890 --> 00:01:02,200
The beginning of generating
power by burning fossil fuels.

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,570
The beginning of the problems
with CO2 and [NOISE OBSCURES]

17
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,210
global warming.

18
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:08,870
In fact, it's interesting
to note that the first

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:16,970
calculation on the impact of CO2
on climate was done in the

20
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:21,170
late 1800's by Arrhenius.

21
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,130
Beginning of a generation of
power moving heat from fossil

22
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,920
fuels to generating energy,
locomotives, etcetera.

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,360
So, he calculated what would
happen to this burning of

24
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,520
fossil fuels, and he decided
in his calculation, he

25
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,380
basically got the calculation
right, by the way, but he came

26
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:44,720
out that in 2,000 years from
the time that he did the

27
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,380
calculations, humans would
be in trouble.

28
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,090
Well, since his calculation,
we've had an exponential

29
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:54,150
growth in the amount of CO2,
and if you go through the

30
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:56,220
calculations of -- people have
done these calculations

31
00:01:56,220 --> 00:02:00,190
throughout times since
Arrhenius, the time that we're

32
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:03,500
in trouble, 2,000 years and the
calculation, has gone like

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,250
this, and so now we're
really in trouble.

34
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,150
That's for a different
lecture.

35
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,590
So, anyway, thermodynamics dates
from the same period as

36
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,180
getting fossil fuels
out of the ground.

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,160
It's universal.

38
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,310
It turns out everything around
us moves energy around in one

39
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:24,850
way or the other.

40
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,090
If you're a biological system,
you're burning calories,

41
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,500
burning ATP.

42
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,980
You're creating heat.

43
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,040
If you're a warm-blooded
animal.

44
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,640
You need energy to move your
arms around and move around --

45
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:41,590
mechanical systems, obviously,
cars, boats, etcetera.

46
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,900
And even in astrophysics, when
you talk about stars, black

47
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,600
holes, etcetera, you're
moving energy around.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,830
You're moving heat around when
you're changing matter through

49
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:51,190
thermodynamics.

50
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,610
And the cause of some
thermodynamics have even been

51
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:59,340
applied to economics, systems
out of equilibrium, like big

52
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,900
companies like Enron, you
know, completely out of

53
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,900
equilibrium, crash and burn.

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:11,520
You can apply non-equilibrium
thermodynamics to economics.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,430
It was developed before
people knew

56
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,630
about atoms and molecules.

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,420
So it's a science that's
based on macroscopic

58
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,480
properties of matter.

59
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,370
Since then, since we know about
atoms and molecules now,

60
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,990
we can rationalize the concepts
of thermodynmamics

61
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,840
using microscopic properties,
and if you are going to take

62
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,470
5.62, that's what you'd
learn about.

63
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:38,010
You'd learn about statistical
mechanics, and how the

64
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,840
atomistic concepts rationalize
thermodynamics.

65
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,970
It doesn't prove it, but it
helps to getting more

66
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,680
intuition about the
consequences of

67
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,570
thermodynamics.

68
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,790
So it applies to macroscopic
systems that are in

69
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,340
equilibrium, and how to go from
one equilibrium state to

70
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,880
another equilibrium state, and
it's entirely empirical in its

71
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,730
foundation.

72
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:08,270
People have done experiments
through the ages, and they've

73
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,310
accumulated the knowledge from
these experiments, and they've

74
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,210
synthesized these experiments
into a few basic empirical

75
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,610
rules, empirical laws,
which are the laws of

76
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:19,840
thermodynamics.

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,415
And then they've taken these
laws and added a structure of

78
00:04:25,415 --> 00:04:30,460
math upon it, to build this
edifice, which is a very solid

79
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,820
edifice of thermodynamics
as a science

80
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,810
of equilibrium systems.

81
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,850
So these empirical observations
then are

82
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,410
summarized into four laws.

83
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,380
So, these laws are, they're
really depillars.

84
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,950
They're not proven, but
they're not wrong.

85
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,340
They're very unlikely
to be wrong.

86
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,810
Let's just go through these
laws, OK, very quickly.

87
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,900
There's a zeroth law The zeroth
law every one of these

88
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,540
laws basically defines the
quantity in thermodynamics and

89
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,330
then defines the concept.

90
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,770
The zeroth law defines
temperature.

91
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,000
That's a fairly common-sense
idea, but it's important to

92
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,090
define it, and I call that
the common-sense law.

93
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:30,150
So this is the common-sense
law.

94
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:37,800
The first law ends up defining
energy, which we're going to

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,680
call u, and the concept of
energy conservation, energy

96
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,880
can't be lost or gained.

97
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,900
And I'm going to call this the
you can break even law; you

98
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,100
can break even law.

99
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,000
You don't lose energy, you
can't gain energy.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,090
You break even.

101
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:09,585
The second law is going to
define entropy, and is going

102
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:11,820
to tell us about the direction
of time, something that

103
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:15,500
conceptually we, clearly,
understand, but is going to

104
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,190
put a mathematical foundation
on which way does time go.

105
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,180
Clearly, if I take a chalk
like this one here, and I

106
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,290
throw it on the ground, and it
breaks in little pieces, if I

107
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,110
run the movie backwards, that
doesn't make sense, right?

108
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:31,900
We have a concept of time
going forward in

109
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,370
a particular way.

110
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:39,190
How does entropy play into
that concept of time?

111
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:48,750
And I'm going to call this the
you can break even at zero

112
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,510
degrees Kelvin law.

113
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:53,560
You can only do it at
zero degrees Kelvin.

114
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:06,200
The third law is going to give
a numerical value to the

115
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:12,940
entropy, and the third law is
going to be the depressing

116
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:23,570
one, and it's going to say, you
can't get to zero degrees.

117
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:26,690
These laws are universally
valid.

118
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:29,820
They cannot be circumvented.

119
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,620
Certainly people have tried
to do that, and every year

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,830
there's a newspaper story, Wall
Street Journal, or New

121
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:42,070
York Times about somebody that
has invented the device that

122
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:46,380
somehow goes around the second
law and makes more energy than

123
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,120
it creates, and this is going
to be -- well, first of all,

124
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,090
for the investors this is going
to make them very, very

125
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,040
rich, and for the rest of us,
it's going to be wonderful.

126
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,760
And they go through these
arguments, and they find

127
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,090
venture money to fund the
company, and they get very

128
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:06,530
famous people to endorse
them, etcetera.

129
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,770
But you guys know, because you
have MIT degrees, and you've,

130
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,080
later, and you've taken 5.60,
that can't be the case, and

131
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,876
you're not going to get fooled
into investing money into

132
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:18,470
these companies.

133
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,980
But it's amazing, that every
year you find somebody coming

134
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:26,330
up with a way of going around
the second law and somehow

135
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:36,090
convincing people who are very
smart that this will work.

136
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,890
So, thermo is also a big tease,
as you can see from my

137
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,230
descriptions of these
laws here.

138
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:46,860
It makes you believe, initially,
in the feasibility

139
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,800
of perfect efficiency.

140
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,190
The first law is very upbeat.

141
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,490
It talks about the conservation
of energy.

142
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,860
Energy is conserved in
all of its forms.

143
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,740
You can take heat energy and
convert it to work energy and

144
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,880
vice versa, and it doesn't say
anything about that you have

145
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,860
to waste heat if you're going
to transform heat into work.

146
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,870
It just says it's energy.

147
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,350
It's all the same
thing, right?

148
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,230
So, you could break even if you
were very clever about it,

149
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:22,400
and that's pretty neat.

150
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,510
So, in a sense, it says, you
know, if you wanted to build a

151
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:29,550
boat that took energy out of the
warmth of the air, to sail

152
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,740
around the world,
you can do that.

153
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,530
And then the second law comes
in and says well, that's not

154
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,040
quite right.

155
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,970
The second law says, yes, energy
is pretty much the same

156
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,040
in all this form, but if you
want to convert one form of

157
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,720
energy into another, if you
want to convert work, heat

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,020
into work, with 100% efficiency,
you've got to go

159
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,250
down to zero degrees Kelvin, to
absolute zero if you want

160
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:57,870
to do that.

161
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:01,050
Otherwise you're going to
waste some of that heat

162
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,920
somewhere along the way,
some of that energy.

163
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,960
All right, so you can't get
perfect efficiency, but at

164
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,280
least if you were able to go to
zero degrees Kelvin, then

165
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,520
you'd be all set.

166
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:14,200
You just got to find a good
refrigerator on your boat, and

167
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,250
then you can still go
around the world.

168
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,690
And then the third law comes
in, and that's the

169
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:19,810
depressing part here.

170
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:21,710
It says, well, it's true.

171
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,980
If you could get to zero degrees
Kelvin, you'd get

172
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,705
perfect efficiency, but you
can't get to zero degrees

173
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:31,180
Kelvin, you can't.

174
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,180
Even if you have an infinite
amount of resources,

175
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:42,750
you can't get there.

176
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,940
Any questions so far?

177
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,720
So thermodynamics, based on
these four laws now, requires

178
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,420
an edifice, and it's a very
mature science, and it

179
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,600
requires that we define
things carefully.

180
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,120
So we're going to spend a little
bit of time making sure

181
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,410
we define our concepts and our
words, and what you'll find

182
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:13,680
that when you do problem sets,
especially at the beginning,

183
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,720
understanding the words and the
conditions of the problem

184
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,260
sets is most of the way into
solving the problem.

185
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:33,560
So we're going to talk about
things like systems.

186
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,110
The system, it's that
part of the

187
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,670
universe that we're studying.

188
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,260
These are going to be fairly
common-sense definitions, but

189
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,390
they're important, and when
you get to a problem set,

190
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:50,440
really nailing down what the
system is, not more, nor less,

191
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,160
in terms of the amount of stuff,
that's part of the

192
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,940
system, it's going to be
often very crucial.

193
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,090
So you've got the system.

194
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,010
For instance, it could
be a person.

195
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,850
I am the system.

196
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:00,620
I could be a system.

197
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,450
It could be a hot coffee
in a thermos.

198
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,620
So the coffee and the milk and
whatever else you like in your

199
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,920
coffee would be the system.

200
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,140
It could be a glass of
water with ice in it.

201
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,520
That's a fine system.

202
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,220
Volume of air in a
part of a room.

203
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,420
Take four liters on this
corner of the room.

204
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,570
That's my system.

205
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:28,950
Then, after you define what your
system is, whatever is

206
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,190
left over of the universe
is the surroundings.

207
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,570
So, if I'm the system, then
everything else is the

208
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:35,860
surroundings.

209
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,500
You are my surroundings.

210
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,370
Saturn is my surroundings.

211
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,340
As far as you can go in the
universe, that's part of the

212
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,300
surroundings.

213
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,600
And then between the
system and the

214
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,120
surroundings is the boundary.

215
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:56,990
And the boundary is a surface
that's real, like the outsides

216
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,740
of my skin, or the inner wall
of the thermos that has the

217
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,030
coffee in it, or it could be
an imaginary boundary.

218
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,340
For instance, I can imagine that
there is a boundary that

219
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,220
surrounds the four liters of
air that's sitting in the

220
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:12,700
corner there.

221
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,790
It doesn't have to be a real
container to contain it.

222
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:21,420
It's just an imaginary
boundary there.

223
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,180
And where you place that
boundary becomes important.

224
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,210
So, for instance, for the
thermos with the coffee in it,

225
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,300
if you place the boundary in the
inside wall of the glass

226
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,600
or the outside wall of the glass
and the inside of the

227
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,560
thermos, that makes a
difference; different heat

228
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,740
capacity, etcetera.

229
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,260
So this becomes where defining
the system and the boundaries,

230
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:42,260
and everything becomes
important.

231
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,970
You've got to place the boundary
at exactly the right

232
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,180
place, otherwise you've got a
bit too much in your system or

233
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:50,630
a bit too little.

234
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,420
More definitions.

235
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:59,170
The system can be an open
system, or it can be a closed

236
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:06,590
system, or it can be isolated.

237
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,030
The definitions are also
important here.

238
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:16,200
An open system, as the name
describes, allows mass and

239
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:21,980
energy to freely flow through
the boundary.

240
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:37,690
Mass and energy flow
through boundary.

241
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:38,680
Mass and energy --

242
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,630
I'm an open system, right?

243
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,910
Water vapor goes through
my skin.

244
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:53,210
I'm hot, compared to the air
of the room, or cold if I'm

245
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,780
somewhere that's warm.

246
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,420
So energy can go
back and forth.

247
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:02,450
The thermos, with the lid on
top, is not an open system.

248
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,890
Hopefully, your coffee is going
to stay warm or hot in

249
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,850
the thermos.

250
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,440
It's not going to get out.

251
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,080
So the thermos is not
an open system.

252
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:13,320
In fact, the thermos is
an isolated system.

253
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,270
The isolated system is the
opposite of the open system,

254
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:22,060
no mass and no energy can flow
through the boundary.

255
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,700
The closed system allows energy
to transfer through the

256
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,320
boundary but not mass.

257
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,080
So a closed system would be, for
instance, a glass of ice

258
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,220
water with an ice cube in
it, with the lid on top.

259
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,580
The glass is not very
insulating.

260
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,720
Energy can flow across the
glass, but I put a lid on top,

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,350
and so the water
can't get out.

262
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,060
And that's the closed system.

263
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,230
Energy goes through the
boundaries but nothing else.

264
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,900
Important definitions, even
though they may sound really

265
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,980
kind of dumb, but they are
really important, because when

266
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,100
you get the problem, figuring
out whether you have an open,

267
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,460
closed, or isolated system,
what are the surroundings?

268
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,240
What's the boundary?

269
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,360
What is the system?

270
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,100
That's the first thing to
make sure that is clear.

271
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,710
If it's not clear, the problem
is going to be

272
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,200
impossible to solve.

273
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,060
And that's also how people find
ways to break the second

274
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,520
law, because somehow they've
messed up on what

275
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,670
their system is.

276
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:27,600
And they've included too much
or too little in the system,

277
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,640
and it looks to them that the
second law is broken and

278
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:35,710
they've created more energy
than is being brought in.

279
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,040
That's usually the case.

280
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,650
Questions?

281
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,880
Let's keep going.

282
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,140
So, now that we've got
a system, we've

283
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,060
got to describe it.

284
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:57,310
So, let's describe
the system now.

285
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:02,120
It turns out that when you're
talking about macroscopic

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,480
properties of matter, you don't
need very many variables

287
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,500
to describe the system
completely thermodynamically.

288
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,110
You just need a few macroscopic
variables that are

289
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:18,875
very familiar to you, like the
pressure, the temperature, the

290
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:22,970
volume, the number of moles of
each component, the mass of

291
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,760
the system.

292
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,910
You've got a magnetic field,
maybe even magnetic

293
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,330
susceptibility, the
electric field.

294
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,750
We're not going to worry about
these magnetic fields or

295
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,620
electric fields in this class.

296
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,590
So, pretty much we're going
to focus on this set

297
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,580
of variables here.

298
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,670
You're going to have to know
when you describe the system,

299
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:48,020
if your system is homogeneous,
like your coffee with milk in

300
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,740
it, or heterogeneous, like water
with an ice cube in it.

301
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,760
So heterogeneous means that
you've got different phases in

302
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,640
your system.

303
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,440
I'm the heterogeneous system,
soft stuff, hard

304
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,340
stuff, liquid stuff.

305
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,730
Coffee is homogeneous, even
though it's made up of many

306
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:06,440
components.

307
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,850
Many different kinds of
molecules make up your coffee.

308
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,190
There are the water molecules,
the flavor molecules, the milk

309
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:12,560
proteins, etcetera.

310
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,930
But it's all mixed
up together in a

311
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,100
homogeneous, macroscopic fashion.

312
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,640
If you drill down at the level
of molecules you see that it's

313
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,010
not homogeneous.

314
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:25,590
But thermodynamics takes
a bird's eye view.

315
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,760
It looks pretty, beautiful.

316
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,410
So, that's a homogeneous
system, one phase.

317
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,250
You have to know if your system
is an equilibrium

318
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,070
system or not.

319
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,370
If it's an equilibrium system,
then thermodynamics can

320
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,750
describe it.

321
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:44,810
If it's not, then you're going
to have trouble describing it

322
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,890
using thermodynamic
properties.

323
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:51,440
Thermodynamics talks about
equilibrium systems and how to

324
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,910
go from one state of equilibrium
to another state

325
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,810
of equilibrium.

326
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,480
What does equilibrium mean?

327
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,490
It means that the properties of
the system, the properties

328
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,140
that describe the system,
don't change

329
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,640
in time or in space.

330
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,110
If I've got a gas in a
container, the pressure of the

331
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,510
gas has to be the same
everywhere in the container,

332
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,880
otherwise it's not
equilibrium.

333
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,930
If I place my container of gas
on the table here, and I come

334
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:21,020
back an hour later, the pressure
needs to be the same

335
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,680
when I come back.

336
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,760
Otherwise it's not
equilibrium.

337
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,570
So it only talks about
equilibrium systems.

338
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:30,920
What else do you need to know?

339
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,990
So, you need to know
the variables.

340
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,250
You need to know it's
heterogeneous or homogeneous.

341
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,260
You need to know if it's an
equilibrium, and you also need

342
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:47,820
to know how many components
you have in your system.

343
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:52,800
So, a glass of ice water with an
ice cube in it, which is a

344
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,470
heterogeneous system, has
only one component,

345
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,110
which is water, H2O.

346
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,980
Two phases, but one component.

347
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,860
Latte, which is a homogeneous
system, has a very, very large

348
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,370
number of components to it.

349
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:09,020
All the components that
make up the milk.

350
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:12,550
All the components that make
up the coffee, and all the

351
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:15,770
impurities, etcetera. cadmium,
heavy metals, arsenic,

352
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:22,050
whatever is in your coffee.

353
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:26,100
OK, any questions?

354
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,480
All right, so we've described
the system with these

355
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,040
properties.

356
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,040
Now these properties come
in two flavors.

357
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,650
You have extensive properties
and intensive properties.

358
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,230
The extensive properties are the
ones that scale with the

359
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,370
size of the system.

360
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,890
If you double the system,
they double in

361
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,700
there numerical number.

362
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,090
For instance, the volume.

363
00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:54,010
If you double the volume,
the v doubles.

364
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,400
I mean that's obvious.

365
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,100
The mass, if you double
the amount of stuff

366
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,780
the mass will double.

367
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,610
Intensive properties don't
care about the

368
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,860
scale of your system.

369
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,730
If you double everything in the
system, the temperature is

370
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,540
not going to change, it's
not going to double.

371
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,050
The temperature stays
the same.

372
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,280
So the temperature is intensive,
and you can make

373
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,170
intensive properties out of the
extensive properties by

374
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,250
dividing by the number of
moles in the system.

375
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,920
So I can make a quantity that
I'll call V bar, which is the

376
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,370
molar volume, the volume of one
mole of a component in my

377
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,270
system, and that becomes
an intensive quantity.

378
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:41,650
A volume which is an
intensive volume.

379
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:51,460
The volumes per mole
of that stuff.

380
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,480
So, as I mentioned,
thermodynamics is the science

381
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:05,260
of equilibrium systems, and it
also describes the evolution

382
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,510
of one equilibrium to
another equilibrium.

383
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,770
How do you go from
one to the other?

384
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:13,850
And so the set of properties
that describes the system --

385
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,550
the equilibrium doesn't
change.

386
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,250
So, these on-changing properties
that describe the

387
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,400
state of the equilibrium
state of the system are

388
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,410
called state variables.

389
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:36,090
So the state variables describe
the equilibrium's

390
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,500
state, and they don't care about
how this state got to

391
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,800
where it is.

392
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,760
They don't care about the
history of the state.

393
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,980
They just know that's if you
have water at zero degrees

394
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,490
Celsius with it ice in, that
you can define it as a

395
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:58,570
heterogeneous system with a
certain density for the water

396
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:01,350
or certain density for the
ice, etcetera, etcetera.

397
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,330
It doesn't care how
you got there.

398
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,960
We're going to find other
properties that do care about

399
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,730
the history of the system, like
work, that you put in the

400
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,450
system, or heat that you
put in the system,

401
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,330
or some other variables.

402
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:18,180
But you can't use those to
define the equilibrium state.

403
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,830
You can only use the
state variables,

404
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,250
independent of history.

405
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,980
And it turns out that for a
one component system, one

406
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,110
component meaning one kind of
molecule in the system, all

407
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:34,400
that you need to know to
describe the system is the

408
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,960
number of moles for a one
component system, and to

409
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,280
describe one phase in that
system, one component,

410
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:53,770
homogeneous system, you need
n and two variables.

411
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:58,810
For instance, the pressure and
the temperature, or the volume

412
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,450
and the pressure.

413
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:03,700
If you have the number of
moles and two intensive

414
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:07,210
variables, then you know
everything there is to know

415
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,790
about the system.

416
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,190
About the equilibrium state
of that system.

417
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:17,200
There are hundreds of quantities
that you can

418
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,590
calculate and measure that are
interesting and important

419
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:23,610
properties, and all you need is
just a few variables to get

420
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,020
everything out, and that's
really the power of

421
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,390
thermodynamics, is that it takes
so little information to

422
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:32,460
get so much information out.

423
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:42,730
So little data to get a lot of
predictive information out.

424
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:51,200
As we're going on with our
definitions, we can summarize

425
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,360
a lot of these definitions into
a notation, a chemical

426
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:00,220
notation that that will
be very important.

427
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,440
So, for instance, if I'm talking
about three moles of

428
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,600
hydrogen, at one bar 100
degrees Celsius.

429
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,190
I'm not going to write, given
three moles of hydrogen at one

430
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,210
bar and three degrees,
blah, blah, blah.

431
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:17,270
I'm going to write it in
a compact notation.

432
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,240
I'm going to write it like this:
three moles of hydrogen

433
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:28,090
which is a gas, one bar
100 degrees Celsius.

434
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,210
This notation gives you
everything you need to know

435
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,590
about the system.

436
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:33,320
It tells you the number
of moles.

437
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
It tells you the phase.

438
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,810
It tells you what kind of
molecule it is, and gives you

439
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,090
two variables that are
state variables.

440
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:44,250
You could have the volume
and the temperature.

441
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,120
You could have the volume
and the pressure.

442
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
But this tells you everything.

443
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,120
I don't need to write
it down in words.

444
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,270
And then if I want to tell you
about a change of state, or

445
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:57,360
let's first start
with a mixture.

446
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,400
Suppose that I give to a
mixture like, this is a

447
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,000
homogeneous system with two
components, like five moles of

448
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:13,870
H2O, which is a liquid, at one
bar 25 degrees Celsius, plus

449
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:23,030
five moles of CH3, CH2, OH,
which is a liquid, and one bar

450
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:26,460
at 25 degrees Celsius.

451
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,340
This describes roughly something
that is fairly

452
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:36,460
commonplace, it's 100-proof
vodka 1/2 water, 1/2 ethanol

453
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,980
-- that describes that
macroscopic system.

454
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,960
You're missing all the
impurities, all the little the

455
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:47,870
flavor molecules that go into
it, but basically, that's the

456
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:50,790
homogeneous system we were
describing, two component

457
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:53,020
homogeneous systems.

458
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,090
Then you can do all sorts
of predictive

459
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,910
stuff with that system.

460
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,740
All right, that's the
equilibrium system.

461
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,560
Now we want to show a notation,
how do we go from

462
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,560
one equilibrium state like
this describes to another

463
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:16,360
equilibrium state?

464
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,150
So, we take our two equilibrium
states, and you

465
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:24,450
just put an equal sign between
them, and the equal sign means

466
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,420
go from one to the other.

467
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,470
So, if we took our three moles
of hydrogen, which is a gas at

468
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:38,150
five bar and 100 degrees
Celsius, and, which is a nice

469
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:40,190
equilibrium state here, and we
say now we're going to change

470
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:43,080
the equilibrium state to
something new, we're going to

471
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,430
do an expansion, let's say.

472
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,265
We're going to drop the
pressure, the volume

473
00:27:50,265 --> 00:27:51,440
is going to go up.

474
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,670
I don't need to tell you the
volume here, because you've

475
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,500
got enough information to
calculate the volume.

476
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,770
The number of moles stays the
same, a closed systems, gas

477
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,500
doesn't come out.

478
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,710
Stays a gas, but now the
pressure is less, the

479
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,510
temperature is less.

480
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,680
I've done some sort of
expansion on this.

481
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,410
I've gone from 1 equilibrium
state to another equilibrium

482
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:15,360
state, and the equal sign means
you go from this state

483
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,090
to that state.

484
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,420
It's not a chemical reaction.

485
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,270
That's why we don't have an
arrow here, because we could

486
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,240
go back, this way too.

487
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,510
We can go back and forth
between these

488
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:25,070
two equilibrium states.

489
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,860
They're connected.

490
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,210
This means they're connected.

491
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:29,750
And when I put this,
I have to tell you

492
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,210
how they are connected.

493
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,310
I have to tell you the
path, if you're

494
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,270
going to solve a problem.

495
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,030
For instance, you want to know
how much energy you're going

496
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:39,260
to get out from doing
this expansion.

497
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,205
How much energy are you going
to get out, and how far are

498
00:28:42,205 --> 00:28:44,610
you going to be able to drive
a car with this expansion,

499
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,540
let's say, so that's
the problem.

500
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,640
So, I need to tell you how
you're doing the expansion,

501
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,290
because that's going to tell
you how much energy you're

502
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,200
wasting during that expansion.

503
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,420
It goes back to the
second law.

504
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,210
Nothing is efficient.

505
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,220
You're always wasting energy
into heat somewhere when you

506
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:03,200
do a change that involves
a mechanical change.

507
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,250
All right, so I need to tell you
the path, when I go from

508
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,550
one state to the other.

509
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,200
And the path is going to be
the sequence, intermediate

510
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,140
states going from the initial
state the final state.

511
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:22,670
So, for instance, if I draw a
graph of pressure on one axis

512
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:27,690
and temperature on the other
axis, my initial state is at a

513
00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:34,950
temperature of 100 degrees
Celsius and five bar.

514
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:42,970
My final stage is 50 degrees
Celsius and one bar.

515
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:46,120
So, I could have two
steps in my path.

516
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,590
I could decide first of all to
keep the pressure constant and

517
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:53,780
lower the pressure.

518
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,880
When I get to 50 degrees
Celsius, I could choose to

519
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,050
keep the temperature constant
and lower the pressure.

520
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,340
I'm sorry, my first step would
be to keep the pressure

521
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,340
constant and lower the
temperature, then I lower the

522
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,200
pressure, keeping the
temperature constant.

523
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,890
So there's my intermediate
state there.

524
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,700
This is one of many paths.

525
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,660
There's an infinite number
of paths you could take.

526
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,490
You could take a continuous
path, where you have an

527
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,170
infinite number of equilibrium
points in between the two, a

528
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,840
smooth path, where you drop
the pressure and the

529
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,600
temperature simultaneously
in little increments.

530
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:36,000
All right, so when you do a
problem, the path is going to

531
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,470
turn out to be extremely
important.

532
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,830
How do you get from
the initial state

533
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,580
to the final state?

534
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,770
Define the initial state.

535
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,870
Define the final state.

536
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,380
Define the path.

537
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:50,990
Get all of these really clear,
and you've basically solved

538
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,420
the problem.

539
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,900
You've got to spend the time to
make sure that everything

540
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,180
is well defined before
you start trying to

541
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,440
work out these problem.

542
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,020
More about the path.

543
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,500
There are a couple ways you
could go through that path.

544
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,830
If I look at this smooth
path here.

545
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:14,955
I could have that path be very
slow and steady, so that at

546
00:31:14,955 --> 00:31:18,320
every point along the way,
my gas is an equilibrium.

547
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,730
So I've got, this piston here
is compressed, and I slowly,

548
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:25,150
slowly increase the volume,
drop the temperature.

549
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:29,910
Then I can go back, the gas
is included at every

550
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,220
point of the way.

551
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,120
That's a reversible path.

552
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,220
That can reverse the process.

553
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,110
I expand it, and reverse
it, no problem.

554
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:49,740
So, I could have a reversible
path, or I take my gas, and

555
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,840
instead of slowly, slowly
raising it, dropping the

556
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,430
pressure, I go from five bar
to one bar extremely fast.

557
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,900
What happens to my gas inside?

558
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,590
Well, my gas inside is going
to be very unhappy.

559
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,800
It's not going stay
in equilibrium.

560
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,940
Parts of the system are going
to be at five bar.

561
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:10,640
Parts of it at one bar.

562
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,270
Parts of it may be even at zero
bar, if I go really fast.

563
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,910
I'm going to create a vacuum.

564
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:21,780
So the system will not be
described by a single state

565
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,480
variable during the path.

566
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,700
If I look at different points
in my container during that

567
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:31,250
path, I'm going to have to use
a different value of pressure

568
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,800
or different value of
temperature at different

569
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,080
points of the container.

570
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,700
That's not an equilibrium state,
and that process turns

571
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,140
out then to be in irreversible
process.

572
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,410
Do it very quickly.

573
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,440
Now to reverse it and get back
to the initial point is going

574
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,510
to require some input from
outside, like heat or extra

575
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,320
work or extra heat or something,
because you've done

576
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,850
an irreversible process.

577
00:32:54,850 --> 00:33:04,810
You've wasted a lot of energy
in doing that process.

578
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,720
I have to tell you whether
the path is reversible or

579
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,580
irreversible, and the
irreversible path also defines

580
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,100
the direction of time.

581
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,000
You can only have an
irreversible path go one way

582
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,750
in time, not the other way.

583
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,070
Chalk breaks irreversibly
and you can't put it

584
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,590
back together so easily.

585
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:29,000
You've got to pretty much take
that chalk, and make a slurry

586
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,270
out of it, put water, and dry it
back up, put in a mold, and

587
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:34,570
then you can have the chalk
again, but you can't just glue

588
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,480
it back together.

589
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,970
That would not be the
same state as what

590
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,990
you started out with.

591
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,280
And then there are a
bunch of words that

592
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,820
describe these paths.

593
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,750
Words like adiabatic, which
we'll be very familiar with.

594
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,290
Adiabatic means that there's
no heat transferred between

595
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,950
the system and the
surrounding.

596
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,520
The boundary is impervious
to transfer of

597
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,580
heat, like a thermos.

598
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,800
Anything that happens inside of
the thermos is an adiabatic

599
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,220
change because the thermos has
no connection in terms of

600
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,560
energy to the outside world.

601
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,940
There's no heat that
can go through the

602
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,530
walls of the thermos.

603
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,760
Whereas, like isobaric means
constant pressure.

604
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,000
So, this path right here from
this top red path is an

605
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,380
isobaric process.

606
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:21,685
Constant temperature means
isothermal, so this part means

607
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,250
an isothermal process.

608
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,580
So then, going from the initial
to final states with a

609
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,160
red path, you start with an
isobaric process and then you

610
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,260
end with an isothermal
process.

611
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,570
And these are words that are
very meaningful when you read

612
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:42,650
the text of a problem
or of a process.

613
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,750
Any questions before we
got to the zeroth law?

614
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,230
We're pretty much done with
our definitions here.

615
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,690
Yes.

616
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:53,040
STUDENT: Was adiabatic
reversible?

617
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,490
PROFESSOR: Adiabatic can be
either reversible or not, and

618
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:57,510
we're going to do that probably

619
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,240
next time or two times.

620
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,110
Any other questions?

621
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,440
Yes.

622
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,390
STUDENT: Is there a boundary
between reversible and

623
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:08,780
irreversible?

624
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,520
PROFESSOR: A boundary between
reversible and irreversible?

625
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,930
Like something is almost
reversible and almost

626
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:15,040
irreversible.

627
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,370
No, pretty much things are
either reversible or

628
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,490
irreversible.

629
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,520
Now, in practice, it
depends on how good

630
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,950
your measurement is.

631
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:35,400
And probably also in practice,
nothing is truly reversible.

632
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:43,650
So, it depends on your
error bar in a sense.

633
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,240
It depends on what what you
define, exactly what you

634
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,470
define in your system.

635
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:50,230
It becomes a gray area, but it
should be pretty clear if you

636
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:57,720
can treat something is
reversible are irreversible.

637
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,970
Other questions, It's
a good question.

638
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,820
So the zeroth law we're going
to go through the laws now.

639
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:11,730
The zeroth law talks about
defining temperature and it's

640
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,440
the common-sense law.

641
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,030
You all know how.

642
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,640
When something hot, it's got a
higher temperature than when

643
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,320
something is cold.

644
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,860
But it's important to define
that, and define something

645
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:23,830
that's a thermometer.

646
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:26,820
So what do you know?

647
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,180
What's the empirical
information

648
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,620
that everybody knows?

649
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,132
Everybody knows that if you take
something which is hot

650
00:36:34,132 --> 00:36:40,140
and something which is cold, and
you bring them together,

651
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:47,900
make them touch, that heat is
going to flow from the hot to

652
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:54,280
the cold, and make them
touch, and heat

653
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,310
flows from hot to cold.

654
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:57,200
That's common sense.

655
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,150
This is part of your DNA, And
then their final product is an

656
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:10,830
object, a b which ends up at
a temperature or a warmness

657
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,070
which is in between the
hot and the cold.

658
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:16,270
So, this turns out to be warm.

659
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,280
You get your new equilibrium
state, which is in between

660
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:28,230
what this was, and what
a and b were.

661
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:34,530
Then how do you know that it's
changed temperature, or that

662
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:37,710
heat has flowed from a to b?

663
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,070
Practically speaking, you need
some sort of property that's

664
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,030
changing as heat is flowing.

665
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:50,420
For instance, if a were
metallic, you could measure

666
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:55,460
the connectivity of a or
resistivity, and as heat flows

667
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:01,870
out of a into b, the resistivity
of a would change.

668
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,520
Or you could have something
that's color metric that

669
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:09,710
changes color when it's colder,
so you could see the

670
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,840
heat flowing as a changes color
or b changes color as

671
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,130
heat flows into b.

672
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,470
So, you need some sort of
property, something you can

673
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:21,130
see, something you can measure,
that tells you that

674
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,880
heat has flowed.

675
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:25,315
Now, if you have three objects,
if you have a, b, and

676
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:35,960
c, and you bring them together,
and a is the

677
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,600
hottest, b is the medium one,
and c is the coldest, so from

678
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,150
hottest to coldest a, b, c, --
if you bring them together and

679
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:53,300
make them touch, you know,
intuitively, that heat will

680
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:57,900
not flow like this.

681
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,650
You know that's not
going to happen.

682
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:03,730
You know that what will happen
is that heat will flow from a

683
00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:07,530
to b from b to c and
from a to c.

684
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:08,340
That's common-sense.

685
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,090
You know that.

686
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:13,170
And the other way in the circle
will never happen.

687
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:16,150
That would that would give rise
to a perpetual motion

688
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:18,030
machine, breaking of
the second law.

689
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,060
It can't happen.

690
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,500
But that's an empirical
observation, that heat flows

691
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,100
in this direction.

692
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,380
And that's the zeroth
law thermodynamic.

693
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:32,090
It's pretty simple.

694
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:38,900
The zeroth law says that if a
and b -- it doesn't exactly

695
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,660
say that, but it implies this.

696
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,230
It says that if a and b are in
thermal equilibrium, if these

697
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,060
two are in thermal equilibrium,
meaning that

698
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,890
there's no heat flows between
them, so that's the definition

699
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,210
of thermal equilibrium, that
no heat flows between them,

700
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,685
and these two are in thermal
equilibrium, and these two are

701
00:39:56,685 --> 00:40:02,380
in thermal equilibrium, then
a and c will be also be in

702
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,910
thermal equilibrium.

703
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:07,030
But if there's no heat flowing
between these two, and no heat

704
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:09,610
flowing between these two,
then you can't have heat

705
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:13,010
flowing between these two.

706
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,920
So if I get rid of these
arrows, there's no heat

707
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,510
flowing because they're in
thermal equilibrium, then I

708
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,640
can't have an arrow here.

709
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,505
That's what the zeroth
law says.

710
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,610
They're all the same
temperature.

711
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,260
That's what it says.

712
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:28,530
If two object are in the same
temperature, and two other

713
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,610
object are in the same
temperature, then all three

714
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:34,610
must have the same
temperature.

715
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,680
It sounds pretty silly, but it's
really important because

716
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,020
it allows you to define a
thermometer and temperature.

717
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:48,790
Because now you can say, all
right, well, now b can be my

718
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,340
thermometer.

719
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:54,290
I have two objects, I have an
object which is in Madagascar

720
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:59,140
and an object which is in
Boston, and I want to know,

721
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,920
are they the same temperature?

722
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,040
So I come out with a third
object, b, I go to Madagascar,

723
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,570
and put b in contact with a.

724
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:11,240
Then I insulate everything, you
know, take it away and see

725
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,640
if there's any heat flow.

726
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,370
Let's say there's
no heat flow.

727
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:18,515
Then I insulate it, get back on
the plane to Boston, and go

728
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:20,010
back and touch b with c.

729
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,680
If there's no heat flow between
the b and c, then I

730
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,280
can say all right, a and c were
the same temperature.

731
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,440
B is my thermometer that tells
me that a and c are in the

732
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,180
same temperature.

733
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,165
And there's a certain property
associated with heat flow with

734
00:41:33,165 --> 00:41:35,860
b, and it didn't change.

735
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,490
And that property
could be color.

736
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,300
It could be resistivity.

737
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,390
It could be a lot of
different things.

738
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,320
It could be volume.

739
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,950
And the temperature then is
associated with that property.

740
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,380
And if it had changed, then the
temperature between those

741
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,830
two would have changed in
a very particular way.

742
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:57,700
So, zeroth law, then, allows you
to define the concept of

743
00:41:57,700 --> 00:42:05,510
temperature and the measurement
of temperature

744
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:09,000
through a thermometer.

745
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,010
Let's very briefly go
through stuff that

746
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,210
you've learned before.

747
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,180
So, now you have this object
which is going to tell you

748
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:19,540
whether other things are in
thermal equilibrium now.

749
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,980
What do you need for
that object?

750
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:27,840
You need that object to be a
substance, to be something.

751
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,630
So, the active part of the
thermometer could be water.

752
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,900
It could be alcohol, mercury, it
could be a piece of metal.

753
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,210
You need a substance, and then
that substance has to have a

754
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,560
property that changes depending
on the heat flow,

755
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:44,820
i.e., depending on whether it's
sensing that it's the

756
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,270
same temperature or different
temperature

757
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:46,930
than something else.

758
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:51,790
And that property could be the
volume, like if you have a

759
00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:54,160
mercury thermometer, the
volume of the mercury.

760
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,090
It could be temperature.

761
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:58,670
It could be resistivity, if
you have a thermocouple.

762
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,980
It could be the pressure.

763
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,110
All right, so now you
have an object.

764
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:06,000
You've got a property
that changes,

765
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,180
depending on the heat flow.

766
00:43:07,180 --> 00:43:09,280
It's going to tell you about
the temperature.

767
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,220
Now you need to define the
temperature scales.

768
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,190
So, you need some reference
points to be able to tell you,

769
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:22,860
OK, this temperature is 550
degrees Smith, whatever.

770
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,380
So, you assign values to very
specific states of matter and

771
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:29,610
call those the reference points
for your temperature.

772
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,840
For instance, freezing of water
or boiling of water, the

773
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,610
standard ones.

774
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:36,150
And then an interpolation
scheme.

775
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:41,050
You need a functional form that
connects the value at one

776
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:45,240
state of matter, the freezing
point of water, to another

777
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,440
phase change, the boiling
point of water.

778
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,420
You can choose a linear
interpolation or quadratic,

779
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,610
but you've got to choose it.

780
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:56,140
And it turns out not
to be so easy.

781
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,630
And if you go back into the
1800's when thermodynamics was

782
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:02,680
starting, there were a zillion
different temperatures scales.

783
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:06,620
Everybody had their own favorite
temperature scales.

784
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:08,550
The one that we're most
familiar with is the

785
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,190
centigrade or Celsius scale
where mercury was the

786
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,970
substance, and the volume of
mercury is the property.

787
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:16,510
The reference points are water,
freezing or boiling,

788
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,180
and the interpolation is linear,
and then that morphed

789
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,940
into the Kelvin scale, as we're
going to see later.

790
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,070
The Fahrenheit scale is
an interesting scale.

791
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,130
It turns out the U.S. and
Jamaica are the only two

792
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:28,670
places on Earth now that use
the Fahrenheit scale.

793
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,800
Mr. Fahrenheit, Daniel Gabriel
Fahrenheit was a German

794
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,890
instrument maker.

795
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,600
The way he came up with his
scale was actually he borrowed

796
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,810
the Romer scale, which
came beforehand.

797
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:47,990
The Romer scale was, Romer was
a Dane, and he defined

798
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:53,900
freezing of water at 7.5 degrees
Roemer, and 22.5

799
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,480
degrees Romer as blood-warm.

800
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,180
That was his definition.

801
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:03,510
Two substances, blood
and water.

802
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:06,160
Two reference points, freezing
and blood-warm, you know, the

803
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,190
human body.

804
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:09,760
A linear interpolation between
the two, and then some numbers

805
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,660
associated with them,
7-1/2 and 22-1/2.

806
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:15,960
Why does he choose 7-1/2 as the
freezing point of water?

807
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,290
Because he thought that would be
big enough that in Denmark,

808
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:22,560
the temperature wouldn't
go below zero.

809
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,140
That's how he picked 7-1/2.

810
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,900
Why not?

811
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,480
He didn't want to use negative
numbers to measure temperature

812
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,130
in Denmark outside.

813
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,740
Well, Fahrenheit came along and
thought, well, you know,

814
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,340
7-1/2, that's kind of silly;
22-1/2 that's, kind of silly.

815
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:40,160
So let's multiply everything
by four.

816
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,390
I think it becomes 30 degrees
for the freezing of water and

817
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,860
22.5 x 4, which I don't know
what it is, 100 or something

818
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:55,480
-- no, it's 90 I think.

819
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,040
And then for some reason, that
nobody understands, he decided

820
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:04,200
to multiply again by 16/15, and
that's how we get 32 for

821
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,340
freezing of water and 96 in his
words for the temperature

822
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,190
in the mouth or underneath
the armpit of a

823
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,390
living man in good health.

824
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,170
What a great temperature
scale.

825
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:16,630
It turns out that 96
wasn't quite right.

826
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:21,110
Then he interpolated and found
out water boils at 212.

827
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,920
But, you know, his experiment
wasn't so great, and, you

828
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,790
know, maybe had a fever when
he did the reference point

829
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:28,720
with 96, whatever.

830
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:31,290
It turns out that it's not 96
to be in good health, it's

831
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,120
98.6 -- whatever.

832
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,760
That's how we got to the
Fahrenheit scale.

833
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,090
All right, next time we're going
to talk about a much

834
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,330
better scale, which is the ideal
gas thermometer and how

835
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:45,380
we get to the Kelvin scale.
