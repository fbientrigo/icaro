8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,160
OK, so we ended up last time, we
talked about Joule-Thomson

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,330
expansion, which is an
irreversible expansion through

10
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,330
a nozzle, through
a porous plug,

11
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,720
constant enthalpy expansion.

12
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:38,040
And I want to make sure
everybody figured out that it

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,740
really was an irreversible
expansion.

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:42,880
Anybody have any questions on
that, because when we voted,

15
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:46,830
the majority of the class
thought it was reversible Yes.

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:49,182
STUDENT: Just a quick question
on some of the constraints,

17
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:51,926
like isothermal, isobaric,
isovolumetric expansion.

18
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:58,080
For isothermal expansion, that
means that delta u does not

19
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,730
change, but delta q is
equal to delta w?

20
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,640
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: So the
question was, for an

21
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,350
isothermal expansion, delta u
does not change, therefore, dq

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,910
is equal to dw.

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,790
The answer is that's true
only for an ideal gas.

24
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:16,360
For a real gas, that
won't be true.

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,550
Ideal gas only depends on the
temperature, the energy only

26
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,970
depends on the temperature.

27
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:24,505
Therefore, if it's isothermal,
the energy of the ideal gas

28
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:25,070
doesn't change.

29
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:29,038
For a real gas it depends on
more than the temperature

30
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:31,712
STUDENT: Are there any other
constraints similar to that

31
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:37,330
[INAUDIBLE].

32
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,055
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: So, for an
ideal gas, the isothermal is

33
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:43,370
the easy one because the
energy doesn't change.

34
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,450
If you have an isobaric you're
going to have to calculate

35
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,310
where the energy changes, and
that's a calculation that's

36
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,610
likely on the homework
and very like on an

37
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,970
exam as well, too.

38
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,090
In fact, we're going to do
some of that today, OK,

39
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,270
calculate delta u.

40
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,160
Any other questions?

41
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,530
Good question.

42
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,850
OK, so we ended up last time
showing that for an ideal gas,

43
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:14,620
that there was was a
relationship between the heat

44
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,110
capacity under constant
pressure, and this is the

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,360
molar heat capacity, that's why
we have the bar on top,

46
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,020
and the molar heat capacity
for constant volume path.

47
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,780
They're related through
the gas constant.

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,860
OK, this is only true for an
ideal gas, and we went through

49
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:34,180
that mathematically where
the, with a chain rule.

50
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,100
And I wanted to do it a
different way which is a

51
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,990
little bit convoluted, but it
introduces the idea of a

52
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,080
thermodynamic cycle, and it's
something that we're going to

53
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,430
use a lot in the class.

54
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,780
Because anytime you're working
with the function of state,

55
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:50,400
and you're trying to connect two
points together in a p-V

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,020
or a T-V diagram, then it
doesn't matter which way

57
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,260
you're connecting those two
points, as long as you're

58
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,100
dealing with state functions
it doesn't matter.

59
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,930
It only matters if you're
looking at the work or the

60
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,040
heat right.

61
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,900
And so sometimes, when you want
to calculate what the

62
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,330
energy is at the endpoint, the
path of the experiment that

63
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,620
you're doing may not be an
easy path to calculate.

64
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,170
You may have to find a different
path which is an

65
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,810
easier one to calculate, and it
doesn't matter which path

66
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,450
you take, because in the end
all you care is what the

67
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,980
energy is at the end.

68
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,770
so we're going to use this
concept of the path to go from

69
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,700
the initial point to
the end point.

70
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,310
As long as you're dealing with
state functions it doesn't

71
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:33,630
matter to get at the
same results here.

72
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:39,100
So we're going to start with a
mole of gas, at some pressure,

73
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:44,405
some volume, temperature and
some mole so V, doing it per

74
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:46,460
mole, and we're going to
do two paths here.

75
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,660
We're going to take a constant
volume path.

76
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:53,550
So V is constant and we're going
to change the pressure

77
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:58,170
to some, a little change in
pressure, V is constant here,

78
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,920
and then temperatures is
also going to change.

79
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,520
So this is a path, which is
either a temperature change,

80
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,160
with the pressure changes at
the same time, going up or

81
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,170
down, constant volume.

82
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:13,606
And since the temperature is
changing, clearly Cv is going

83
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,220
to have something
to do with this.

84
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,990
So constant volume path, where
the temperature is changing.

85
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:24,040
So somehow this is going
to allow us to get Cv.

86
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,030
Cv is going to be related
to this path.

87
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:32,350
And if I draw a diagram on a T-V
diagram of what I'm doing

88
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,130
here, so there's temperature
axis.

89
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,020
There's the volume axis here.

90
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,580
I'm starting with
some V1 here.

91
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:47,170
And this is going to
be here V plus dV.

92
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,100
So I'm starting right here.

93
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,100
This is my initial point.

94
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,610
And the path that I'm describing
then, let's assume

95
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,660
that we're raising the
temperature up is this path

96
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,110
right here.

97
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,060
OK, this is my constant
volume path going

98
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:07,780
from T to T plus dT.

99
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,920
OK, we'll call this 1 here.

100
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:14,810
All right, now I want to make a
path where out of that path,

101
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,450
C sub p is going to fall out.

102
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,570
So that's going to have to be
a constant pressure path.

103
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:19,880
Temperature is going to
change but pressure

104
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,270
is going to be constant.

105
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,660
So what I can do is I can take
my initial point here and

106
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,720
create a new, different path,
where, which is going to be a

107
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,560
constant pressure path.

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,210
So at the end of this path
the pressure is constant.

109
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,130
The volume is going to change
though, to some new volume dV

110
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,995
and the temperature is going to
change also and I'm going

111
00:05:39,995 --> 00:05:42,820
to make it the same endpoint
temperature as the endpoint

112
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,020
temperature here.

113
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,500
And out of this path, since the
pressure is constant but

114
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,630
the temperature is changing, I'm
hoping that C sub p will

115
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:53,260
fall out of that path
of that calculation.

116
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,290
All right?

117
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,080
This should give us something
about C sub p.

118
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,470
So this will give us something
about C sub v. This will give

119
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,610
us something about C sub p.

120
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,400
Now these two endpoints
here are different.

121
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,060
They have a different pressure,
a different volume.

122
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,770
They do have the same
temperature though.

123
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,790
So the connection between
this endpoint here,

124
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,580
and that one here.

125
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,520
Same temperature.

126
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,320
It's going to be an isothermal
path that's

127
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,270
going to connect them.

128
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,760
So I'm going to connect them in
an isothermal way, and as,

129
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,740
since I'm dealing with an ideal
gas, and as we saw from

130
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,270
the first question here,
isothermal always means delta

131
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,270
u equals zero.

132
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:34,090
So I'm going to write that
immediately here, delta u

133
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,010
equal zero, because I know the
answer to that path here.

134
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,040
All right, so let's go again
what our paths are.

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,290
Path number 1 I'm
going straight

136
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,740
up in the V-T diagram.

137
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,100
Path number 2 on my diagram it's
a reversible, this path

138
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,900
number 2, it's a reversible
constant pressure path.

139
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,820
So I'm going to be keeping the
pressure constant, but my

140
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:02,450
volume is going to go up.

141
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,910
My temperature is
going to go up.

142
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:11,380
Basically I'm putting
heat in this system.

143
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:14,590
That's going to be number
2 right here.

144
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,400
It's going to be the same
temperature as before but the

145
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,370
volume is V plus dV now.

146
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:23,830
That's 2, and then, so I'm
heating up the system in this

147
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,100
path here, and then to connect
the 2 endpoints here, I'm

148
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,440
going to connect them through
a constant temperature path.

149
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,300
Basically I'm going to cool down
the system so that the --

150
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,060
no, I'm not going to cool down,
I'm going to compresses

151
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,090
the system back to the smaller
volume V1 and the constant

152
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,560
temperature conditions.

153
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,970
So that's path number 3 here.

154
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,710
And I'm only going to
worry about energy

155
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,850
in this case here.

156
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,850
Because I know energy doesn't
care about the path.

157
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,400
Energy only cares about where
I am on the diagram.

158
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,000
And I know energy is related to
Cv through Cv dT etcetera.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,540
So if I worry about energy I
have a pretty good chance of

160
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,030
extracting out these heat
capacities, right, and I don't

161
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,830
have to worry about exactly
which path and I can really

162
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:14,490
mix things up.

163
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:21,180
So let's start the process.

164
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,960
So the first path then, the
first path, constant volume

165
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,030
constant V, so I'm going
to, again, let's

166
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,000
just worry about energy.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,320
So du for this first path here,
du for path 1, and write

168
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,280
dq plus dw what we
usually write.

169
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,170
Now it's constant volume when
the volume is constant.

170
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,210
There's no work being done
so I can immediately

171
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,820
ignore this dw here.

172
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,070
Constant volume dq = Cv dT.

173
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,100
Now it's an ideal gas.

174
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,250
So in some sense, I did too
much work by writing this,

175
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:02,500
because I knew already
du = Cv dT.

176
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,970
I could have written that down
immediately, but I just went

177
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,540
through the process of writing
the first law, what's dw, what

178
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,116
dq, Cv dT, etcetera.

179
00:09:10,116 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm just writing what we
already know basically.

180
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,670
Let's look at path number 2.

181
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,880
Path number 2.

182
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,000
OK, let's look at the dw, du
again. du for path number 2.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,870
dq like the first law down, dq
plus dw, then -- what's dq?

184
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:31,770
Well it's a constant pressure
path. dq is related to the

185
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,995
temperature, the change in
temperature. dT through the

186
00:09:33,995 --> 00:09:37,180
heat capacity, happens to be
constant pressure, so this is

187
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,420
exactly what we want.

188
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,712
Cp, I forgot to put my little
bar on top here because it's

189
00:09:41,712 --> 00:09:46,410
per mole Cp dT that's
my dq here.

190
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,660
The path is constant pressure.

191
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,500
And then the dw.

192
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,210
Well there's a change now
in volume and pressure.

193
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,690
So I need, well the pressure
is constant, but there's a

194
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:54,580
change in volume.

195
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,690
Minus p dV is the change,
is the work, right?

196
00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:07,820
So I can write that down minus
p dV for that path there.

197
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:12,320
OK, now but it's an ideal gas,
so I know something about the

198
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,080
relationship between dV
and dT, because I've

199
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,320
got dT here the dV.

200
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,890
I don't want to have so
many variables around.

201
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,130
I've got three variables, T, p
and V. I know I only need 2,

202
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:24,950
so I can relate dV to dp through
the ideal gas law.

203
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:28,870
P dV is equal to R dT.

204
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:34,770
pV = RT for 1 mole, so I just
take dV here. dT here because

205
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:43,190
the pressure is constant, so
dV is equal to R over p dT.

206
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:44,150
Then pressure is constant.

207
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,730
So I can instead of the
dV here, I can insert

208
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,940
this R over p dT.

209
00:10:48,940 --> 00:11:00,970
The p's cancel out, and now
I have Cp dT minus R dT.

210
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:03,480
This is equal to
Cp minus R dT.

211
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,980
All right, let's complete
the cycle now, the

212
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,760
path number 3 here.

213
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,080
Path number 3 is a constant
temperature path, and I

214
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,260
already wrote the answer.

215
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,310
Constant temperature isothermal
delta u is zero.

216
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,440
There's no thinking involved.

217
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,040
It's one of these things like
I mentioned last time, if I

218
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,350
tell you delta H in the middle
of the night what you say, q

219
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,170
Cp for reversible process.

220
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:35,680
Same thing here. isothermal
process, what do you say?

221
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,900
Delta u is zero, right?

222
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,590
It should be completely
second nature.

223
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,200
So delta u is zero here.

224
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,040
Delta u sub 3 is, for
an ideal gas.

225
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,900
I gotta put that constraint
in there for an ideal gas.

226
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,370
Delta u is equal to zero.

227
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:52,060
So now I'm back at
the same place.

228
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,090
I'm back here right.

229
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:58,610
So path number 1 went from i,
let's call this path up here.

230
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,870
went to f, and this is how much
energy change there was.

231
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,430
The sum of path number 2 and
path number 3 get me to the

232
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:10,660
same place, so the energy change
by going through this

233
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,410
time path, this intermediate
point here back all the way to

234
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:18,760
final state should be the
same the red path.

235
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:24,530
So what I'm saying is that du
through path 1 should be equal

236
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:30,200
to du through path 2 plus
du going through path 3.

237
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,940
All right, because energy
doesn't care about the path.

238
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,350
It only cares about
the end points.

239
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:36,550
OK, so now let's plug what
is du through path 1?

240
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:47,440
It's Cp dT and the du through
path 2 is Cp minus R dT and

241
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,950
then du through path
3 is zero.

242
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,810
It's the isothermal process.

243
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:56,110
The dT is cancelled out and
voila I have my answer.

244
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:04,820
Cv is equal, oh Cv plus R is
equal to Cp whichever way you

245
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,280
want to do it, it's a
relationship that we had up

246
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,990
here that we wanted to prove.

247
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:18,110
Now, I wanted to go to through
this just to go through one

248
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:20,570
cycle quickly because we're
going to be doing these all

249
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,140
the time, and the importance
of the fact that the path

250
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,360
doesn't matter, and you can
always connect things together

251
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,590
in a way, whatever you want.

252
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,340
Whatever is the easiest.

253
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,970
If you want to calculate
a change in delta u.

254
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:34,670
Now if you look at my derivation
here, there's one

255
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:38,780
spot where I could have just
stopped and proven my point

256
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,780
without going through
the whole thing.

257
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,750
So if you look at path number 2
here, the constant pressure

258
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:51,240
path du is Cp minus R
dT, du is Cp minus

259
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,900
r dT for that path.

260
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,810
What is du for an ideal gas?

261
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:00,350
It's -- what else do we know
that du is always equal to for

262
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:02,470
an ideal gas?

263
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,470
Cv dT right.

264
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,140
So I could have written right
here immediately equals Cv dT,

265
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,010
and that was the end
of my derivation.

266
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,830
I could have done that.

267
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,410
It would've been easier, but I
wanted to go through the whole

268
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:16,490
path right?

269
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:23,850
OK, any questions?

270
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:24,340
Cool.

271
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,590
All right, so we're going
to be doing more

272
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:28,750
thermodynamics processes.

273
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,210
We're building up to entropy
and to engines,

274
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,430
Carnot cycles, etcetera.

275
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:37,850
And so we need to build our
repertoire of knowledge in

276
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:41,070
manipulating these cycles like
the one I drew on the board

277
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:44,840
that's hidden now You've
already seen the simple

278
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,510
process, which is the isothermal
process, and you've

279
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,620
seen how to functionalize, or
what the function is that

280
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,620
describes the isothermal
expansion.

281
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:01,520
Let's say we start from some
V1 and p1 here, so high

282
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,920
pressure, small volume and we
end up with a high volume low

283
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,780
pressure, under constant
temperature condition.

284
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:19,480
So there's some path,
isothermal, so T is constant.

285
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,240
And we know the functional form
for this path, it's the

286
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,360
ideal gas law, pV
= RT, pV = nRT.

287
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:35,965
T is constant, so the functional
form here is pV is

288
00:15:35,965 --> 00:15:38,770
equal to a constant.

289
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,380
All right, or p is equal to a
constant divided by volume.

290
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,280
If you want to write a function
that describes this

291
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,180
line here, it's pressure as a
function of volume related to

292
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,360
each other with this constant.

293
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,290
So we know how to do this.

294
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:57,210
So this allows us to calculate
all sorts of things to get

295
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:59,050
these functional forms.

296
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,060
That's the isotherm here.

297
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,750
We also know how to calculate
the work.

298
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:07,170
If it's a reversible process,
we know the work is the area

299
00:16:07,170 --> 00:16:13,370
under the curve. w reversible.
in this case here let's see

300
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,570
this is it's a pressure
is going down.

301
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:22,180
It's an expansion, so we're
doing work against the

302
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,950
environment, or to
the environment.

303
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,080
So work is leaving the system.

304
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:32,180
So minus w reversible is going
to be a positive number.

305
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,460
V1 to V2 and RT -- you've done
this already last time or a

306
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:45,200
couple of times ago and you end
up with minus nRT log p2

307
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,080
over p1, OK?

308
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,890
So minus w reversible, we're
doing work to the environment.

309
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:54,260
This should be a positive
number. p2 is less than p1, so

310
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,940
p2 over p1 is less than one, log
of something less than 1

311
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,150
is negative times negative.

312
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,040
So in fact this is indeed a
positive number so we didn't

313
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,130
make a mistake in our signs.

314
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:05,460
You always want to check your
signs at the and because it's

315
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,190
so easy to get the sign wrong,
and I was hoping that it was

316
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:11,750
right here because I
wasn't sure, but it

317
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,520
turned out to be right.

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,120
Always check your
sign at the end.

319
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,580
All right so we know
how to do this.

320
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,440
Now we are going to do the same
thing with a different

321
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:19,940
constraint.

322
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,290
Our constraint is going to be
an adiabatic expansion or

323
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:23,950
compression.

324
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,960
Adiabatic meaning there's no
heat involved, and we're going

325
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,390
to see how that differs from the
isothermal expansion and

326
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:31,000
compression.

327
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,610
OK, so this is the
experiment then.

328
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,740
We're going to take a
piston here which

329
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,350
is going to be insulated.

330
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:45,240
It's going to have some volume,
temperature to begin

331
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,570
with, and then we're going
to do something to it.

332
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,130
We're going to change the
pressure above, right now

333
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:59,270
there's a p external, which is
equal to p on the inside.

334
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,790
OK, we're going to do this
reversibly, which means we're

335
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,270
going to slowly change the
external pressure very, very

336
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:10,040
slightly at a time, so that at
every point we're basically in

337
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,430
equilibrium, until the pressure
reaches a new smaller

338
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,850
pressure p2.

339
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,640
So that's going to results in
an expansion where the new

340
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:25,240
volume new temperature new
pressure and an external

341
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,730
pressure, which is p2 which
is a smaller pressure.

342
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:31,730
It's really important that this,
that you remember that

343
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,470
this is the reversible case.

344
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,730
We're going to also look at the
irreversible case briefly.

345
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:42,590
So on the p-V diagram, then,
there's a V1 here a V2 here, a

346
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,210
p1 here a p2 here.

347
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:49,830
This V2 is going to be different
than this one here.

348
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,250
A priori we don't
know what it is.

349
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,680
We don't know if it's
bigger or smaller.

350
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,810
We kind of feel like it's going
to be different because

351
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,840
it's a different constraint.

352
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,200
This is isothermal.

353
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,300
This is adiabatic,
there's no heat.

354
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,340
So there's going to be a line
that's going to connect the

355
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:08,540
initial point to the final
point, and that line

356
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:12,050
mathematically is not going to
be the same as this one here.

357
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:14,620
And our job is to find out
what is the mathematical

358
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,420
description of this path, this
line in p-V's case that

359
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:21,200
connects these two point.

360
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,250
And again, I want to stress
this is a reversible path.

361
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,730
If it was non-reversible, I
would be allowed to put an

362
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:35,450
initial point and a final
point, but I wouldn't be

363
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,060
allowed to put a path between
them like this, connecting

364
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,570
them together.

365
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,230
Because if it's irreversible,
it's very likely that I don't

366
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,510
know what the pressure inside
the system is doing while this

367
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,030
is happening.

368
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,200
It could be very chaotic.

369
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,860
The pressure could not be, might
not even be constant

370
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,900
throughout the system.

371
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,110
It could have eddies and
all sorts of things.

372
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:56,340
So for an irreversible process,
I wouldn't really be

373
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,830
allowed to put a path there.

374
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,670
I can do that because it's
reversible, and I can get a

375
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,130
functional form out.

376
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,110
What we're going to find in
this process is that the

377
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:12,070
functional form from this is
that p is related to the

378
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:16,380
volume through a constant, but
instead of being V to the

379
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:19,820
first power as it was for the
isothermal, it's now a V to

380
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:22,480
some constant gamma.

381
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:31,620
What we're going to find is that
gamma is greater than 1.

382
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:39,440
And if gamma is greater than
1, and you're changing the

383
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,990
pressure to the same final
point, what we're going to

384
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,450
find then is the volume that
you go to is going to be a

385
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,030
smaller volume than for
the isothermal.

386
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,350
We're going to go through these
points, so don't worry

387
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:53,130
about getting at all
straight right now.

388
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,120
All right, so let's do this.

389
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,370
Let's try to show this.

390
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,900
Let's try to show that in fact
this is the right functional

391
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:02,990
form, that pV to the gamma is
equal to constant is the right

392
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,880
form that describes the path in
an adiabatic expansion or

393
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,270
compression.

394
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,970
So let's do the experiment.

395
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,940
Let's write everything
that we know down.

396
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,630
This is where, the way that we
should start every problem set

397
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,110
or ever problem.

398
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:23,760
It's writing everything we
know and what it means.

399
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,250
OK, so adiabatic.

400
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:31,050
All the words mean things
mathematically.

401
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,850
Adiabatic means dq
equals zero.

402
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:38,280
Let's write that down.
dq equals zero.

403
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,940
Reversible.

404
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,550
Reversible means that if I
looked at dw it's minus p

405
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:46,310
reversible.

406
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:50,940
It's minus p external dV, that's
what it is, but in the

407
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,690
reversible process p external
is equal to p.

408
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,110
That's the only time you can set
p external equal to p is

409
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:01,580
if it's reversible.

410
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,710
So this is the external
pressure.

411
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,130
This is the internal pressure
of the system.

412
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:09,830
You can only do this because
it's reversible.

413
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,950
What else do I know?

414
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:15,790
It's an ideal gas.

415
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:24,660
So I can write du is Cv dT
and pV is equal to RT.

416
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:30,540
OK.

417
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,170
So what else can I write?

418
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:42,220
Well from the first law, du is
equal to dq plus dw, and I

419
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,600
wrote down everything I knew
at the beginning here.

420
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,900
I wrote dq equals zero
I wrote what dw was.

421
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:51,320
So du is just minus p dV.

422
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,540
Now from the ideal gas,
I have another

423
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,260
expression for du, Cv dT.

424
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,360
So now I have two expressions
for du.

425
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,440
That's a good thing, because I
can them equal to each other.

426
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:08,250
So if you get these two guys
together you get Cv dT is

427
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,170
minus p dV.

428
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,540
So we're connecting temperature
and changes in

429
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:21,780
temperature and changes
in volume together.

430
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,380
OK, now we don't really
want this p here.

431
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,750
This is going to be a function,
I only need two

432
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,670
variables, and here I've got
three variables down.

433
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,240
So I know p is going to be a
function of T and V, and I

434
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,740
know how to relate p to
T and V because I know

435
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,040
the ideal gas law.

436
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:44,230
So instead of p, here I'm going
to put nRT over V. or RT

437
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,980
over V bar.

438
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:56,640
So now, this expression becomes
Cv dT over T is equal

439
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:05,210
to minus R dV over V. And I
also did a little bit of

440
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:05,980
rearrangement.

441
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,748
Yes?

442
00:24:06,748 --> 00:24:22,100
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

443
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,920
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: Well, let's
see. du is, for an ideal gas,

444
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:30,240
it's always equal to Cv dT.

445
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,580
Constant volume process tells
you that if you have a

446
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,440
constant volume, then
dq is Cv dT.

447
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,970
This is what the constant volume
path tells you, that

448
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,770
you can equate Cv dT with dq.

449
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:45,620
The ideal gas tells you that
this is always true here.

450
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:49,920
It's an ideal gas in adiabatic
expansion dq is equal to zero.

451
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,500
Adiabatic expansion means you
can't use this. dq is zero.

452
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,690
The that is adiabatic.

453
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,890
It's not constant volume.

454
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,680
You're allowed Cv comes out
here for this adiabatic

455
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,090
expansion, which is not a
constant volume only because

456
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,510
this is always true
for an ideal gas.

457
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,740
We didn't use a constraint
that V is constant.

458
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:16,640
Just use this as an
ideal gas here.

459
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,620
OK, so we've got dT
here dV here.

460
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,250
We want to get rid
of derivatives.

461
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,850
We want to integrate.

462
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,620
So let's take the integral of
both sides, going from the

463
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,220
initial point to the
final point.

464
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:35,750
We've got Cv integral from T1
to T2, dT over T is equal to

465
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:44,050
minus R from V1 to V2 dV over
V. OK, we do take that

466
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:51,600
integral, and that leads us to
Cv log of T2 over T1 is equal

467
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:58,150
to minus R log of V2 over V1,
and now we know how to

468
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,950
rearrange this, because the Cv
times a log of T2 over T1 is

469
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,360
the same thing as the
log of T2 over T1 to

470
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,820
the Cv power, right.

471
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,480
So by rearranging these
expression of the logs here,

472
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,660
this is the same thing is
writing log T2 over T1 to the

473
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:25,110
Cv power is equal to log of
V1 over V2 to the R power.

474
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,910
And I've reversed the fraction
here because of the

475
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:33,780
negative sign here.

476
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:43,080
OK, get rid of the logs, and
you get that T2 over T1 is

477
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:52,390
equal to V1 over V2 to the R
over Cv by taking this Cv and

478
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:56,520
bringing it on the
other side here.

479
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:01,780
OK, so now we've got the initial
and final points, a

480
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:04,530
relationship between the
temperature and volume for the

481
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,320
initial and final points.

482
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,650
Eventually that's not
what we want.

483
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:12,830
Eventually we want the same
relationship in the pressure

484
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,430
and volume.

485
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:18,600
We want a relationship in p-V
space, not in T-V space.

486
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,870
So we're going to have to
do something about that.

487
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:23,670
But first, it turns out that
now we have this R over Cv.

488
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,260
and remember, we have this
relationship between R Cv and

489
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,680
Cp here, which is going
to be interesting.

490
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:36,630
So let's get rid of R in
this expression here.

491
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:41,280
So R over Cv, R is
Cp minus Cv.

492
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,950
We proved that first thing this
morning, divided by Cv so

493
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:52,700
this is Cp over Cv minus 1 and
because I know the answer of

494
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,510
this whole thing here, I'm going
to call this thing here,

495
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,440
Cp over Cv.

496
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm going to call it gamma.

497
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,530
Because I know the
answer, right.

498
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:02,980
I know the answer.

499
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,070
I'm going to call this gamma.

500
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:13,520
By definition I'm going to
define gamma by Cp over Cv by

501
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,180
definition.

502
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:19,730
OK, so that means that this is
really instead of R over Cv.

503
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,410
it's really gamma minus one.

504
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:29,300
So now I've got this gamma
placed in there, gamma minus

505
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,960
1, so I've ben feeling
a little bit better.

506
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,350
I've gotten V to the gamma
power almost to the gamma

507
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,640
power, it's minus 1 here.

508
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,120
But it's almost right and I'm
looking for something like

509
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,550
this here, V to the gamma power
pV to the gamma power is

510
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,880
a constant to describe
that line.

511
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,580
So I just got to get rid
of the temperature now.

512
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,450
Somehow I've gotta get rid of
the temperature and make it

513
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:58,260
pressure instead.

514
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:04,500
OK, so let's -- let me get rid
of this here, let's use the

515
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,230
ideal gas law to get rid
of the temperature.

516
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:17,800
So we have T is pV over R. So
now if I look at my V1 over V2

517
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:24,360
to the gamma minus 1,
that's T2 over T1.

518
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,750
I'll replace the ideal gas
law for those two T's.

519
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:34,770
That p2 V2 over R, and then I
have p1 V1 over R, the R's

520
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,620
cancel out.

521
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:39,390
Well let's see, there's a V1
over V2 to the gamma minus 1.

522
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,790
There's a V1 over V2
here or V2 over V1.

523
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,470
That's going to get rid
of this minus 1 here.

524
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:49,180
Then I'm going to get, be
left with a p2 over p1.

525
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:54,650
So this guy here gets rid of
this, and I have my answer as

526
00:29:54,650 --> 00:30:01,860
V1 over V2 to the gamma power
is equal to p2 over p1.

527
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:08,630
Or I can re-write this as p1, V1
to the gamma is equal to p2

528
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,310
V2 to the gamma.

529
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:18,750
That means that p1 and -- where
I am, the point number 1

530
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,150
and point number 2 were
completely arbitrary.

531
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:24,390
They happen to be on the path.

532
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:30,060
So any point I pick on that path
will be equal to p1, V1

533
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,570
to the gamma.

534
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:34,400
So if I take p times V to the
gamma, anywhere on the path,

535
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,350
it's going to be equal
to the same relation

536
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,140
from my first point.

537
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,590
This is going to be true for
any point on the path.

538
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:44,000
As long as I'm on the path, pV
to the gamma will be whatever

539
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,110
it was for the first point,
which is going to be some sort

540
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:52,130
of constant.

541
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:53,540
All right, so I've
proven my point.

542
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,750
I've proven what I was trying to
do, which was to show that

543
00:30:55,750 --> 00:31:03,230
on this adiabat, everywhere on
the adiabat, if you take a

544
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,500
functional form that relates p
and V together, it's going to

545
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,540
have this relationship with
gamma as related to the heat

546
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,570
capacities.

547
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:18,020
Gamma is Cp over Cv.

548
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:26,660
OK, now there's more we can say
because we know that's Cp

549
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,533
is related to Cv through
this R here, and R

550
00:31:28,533 --> 00:31:30,310
is a positive number.

551
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:34,610
So Cp is always bigger
than Cv.

552
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:42,810
In fact, if it's an ideal gas
Cv and Cp are well defined

553
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,530
numbers, it turns out.

554
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:56,970
If you have a monotomic ideal
gas, OK, so an atomic version,

555
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:02,330
not a molecular ideal gas, then
it turns out that Cv is

556
00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:09,380
equal to 3/2 R, and therefore,
Cp which is just R plus this

557
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:13,430
is five halves R, which means
that gamma for a mono atomic

558
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,470
ideal gas is 5/3.

559
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:22,630
So if you have a gas of argon
atoms, you know what gamma is.

560
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,490
This is something that you're
going to prove in statistical

561
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:28,870
mechanics, and so we're not
going to worry about where

562
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,840
this comes from.

563
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,200
We're just going to take
it for granted.

564
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,190
All right, so gamma is for ideal
gas, is bigger than one.

565
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,820
In fact we have a number
for it if it's an

566
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,790
atomic ideal gas.

567
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:47,030
So what it means then is if I
look at if this relationship

568
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:51,780
here, gamma is bigger than 1,
so gamma something bigger

569
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,460
than 1 minus 1.

570
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,440
This is, so this is
positive here.

571
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,820
It's positive.

572
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:04,480
So if I have an expansion where
V2 is greater than V1,

573
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:15,510
so V2 is greater than V1, so
this is a number which is less

574
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:24,860
than one, then I expect then T2
is going to be less and T1,

575
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,630
T2 is less than T1.

576
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:37,800
OK, I have this number here to
a power, which is positive, a

577
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,160
positive power.

578
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,760
And its number is
less than one.

579
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:41,970
This is going to give
me something which

580
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,060
is less than one.

581
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:49,090
So T2 is less than T1, and I
have a cooling of a gas.

582
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,490
So whenever you have an
adiabatic expansion, the

583
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,980
temperature cools,
it gets colder.

584
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:06,740
It gets colder, and if I look at
my graph here, then if the

585
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:11,925
volume of the expansion, if
the temperature of the

586
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:18,120
adiabatic expansion was colder,
that means that --

587
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,540
this is the wrong graph here.

588
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,710
If I want to compare it with
the isothermal expansion,

589
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:32,320
which is sitting here.

590
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:41,650
All right, so gamma, the gas is
cooling so V2 is going to

591
00:34:41,650 --> 00:34:44,080
be less than it what
would be if the

592
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,050
temperature kept constant.

593
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,720
So finally, on the same graph,
I put down what an isothermal

594
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,650
expansion would be, if my final
pressure is the same

595
00:34:53,650 --> 00:35:02,570
pressure, my volume for an
isothermal expansion will be

596
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,530
bigger than for an adiabatic
expansion.

597
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,950
So when I expand this gas
adiabatically and it cools

598
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:16,650
down, why do you think
it might cool down?

599
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,270
It cools down because I'm
doing work through the

600
00:35:19,270 --> 00:35:23,360
environment, but the energy has
to go somewhere, right?

601
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:26,440
There's an interplay between
the energy inside the gas

602
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,480
which is the heat energy which
is allowing me to do all that

603
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,100
work to be outside, and so I'm
using up some of the energy

604
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:37,420
that's inside the gas to do
the work on the outside.

605
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:42,980
And here, in an isothermal
expansion, The bath is putting

606
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:49,380
back the energy that the gas
is expanding or using to

607
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,620
expand, and so the energy is
flowing back into the gas

608
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,310
through the environment in
the isothermal expansion.

609
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:02,800
In the opposite case, if you
have a compression, then it's

610
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,750
the opposite of expansion.

611
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,300
Compression you're expected
to heat up, right?

612
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:12,880
So in the compression, you're
going to have V2

613
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:13,720
is less than V1.

614
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:19,420
So that T2 is going to
be greater than T1.

615
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:23,990
That's going to be your
heating up of the gas.

616
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,860
And that really is
the bicycle pump.

617
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,410
That example I gave last time
with the bicycle pump was not

618
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,330
quite the right example.

619
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,900
But this time this really
is the bicycle pump.

620
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,350
That you're pushing
really hard on it.

621
00:36:34,350 --> 00:36:37,650
So you start with the
bicycle pump at one

622
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,060
bar, let's say, right?

623
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,760
And you compress the air
in the bicycle pump.

624
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:48,060
You do it so quickly that the
heat flow between the inside

625
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,700
of the bicycle pump and the
outside is too slow compared

626
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,620
to the speed at which
you compress.

627
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,770
But you don't compress it so
quickly that you're not in

628
00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:01,100
there reversible process so you
compress that if you were

629
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,590
to feel the temperature of the
air and you can feel it

630
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,010
through the nozzle gives you an
idea of the temperature of

631
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,080
the air inside your
bicycle pump.

632
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,360
You'll feel that it's warmer.

633
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:13,290
You've just done an adiabatic
compression of the ideal gas,

634
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:15,300
you can pretend there
is an ideal gas.

635
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,040
And that gives rise to
the heating that you

636
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,160
can actually measure.

637
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:36,930
OK, any questions on
this part here.

638
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,470
All right, so we've just gone
through the reversible

639
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:46,140
adiabatic, and I'm not going
to do this in detail, but I

640
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,200
want to go through the
irreversible adiabatic fairly

641
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:58,000
quickly, and see where the
difference is here.

642
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,960
OK, so now we're going to do the
same kind of experiment,

643
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,270
but irreversibly.

644
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:09,270
An irreversible adiabatic.

645
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:17,870
OK, so the experiment is going
to be to take my cylinder now,

646
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:21,480
and the external pressure and
the internal pressure are not

647
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,680
going to be in equilibrium
with each

648
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,180
other during the process.

649
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,890
I'm going to start with my
cylinder here, I'm going to

650
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,460
put little pegs here so
it doesn't fly up.

651
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,970
There's going to be some
external pressure.

652
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,140
I'm going to set that
equal to p2.

653
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,410
There is going to be an internal
pressure where p1 is

654
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,360
less than p2 and there's
V1 and T1 here.

655
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:44,170
The whole thing is going
to be insulated.

656
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,170
Then I'm going to release these
little pegs here and my

657
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:50,730
piston is going to shoot
up now because p2

658
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,300
is less than p1.

659
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,790
So p2 is less than p1, the
external pressures is less

660
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,660
than the internal pressure.

661
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:01,220
So it's going to shoot up until
the internal pressure

662
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,190
and the external pressure
are in equilibrium.

663
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:13,300
So they're both p2. external is
p2 and I have p2, V2, T2,

664
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:17,470
on the other side.

665
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:28,640
OK, so in my diagram now, I have
p1, V1 for my gas. p2, V2

666
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,560
for my gas, so I know that I'm
starting here and I know that

667
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,930
I'm ending here, but I can't
connect this path here.

668
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:38,470
I don't know how to do that.

669
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:41,950
It's an irreversible
expansion.

670
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:43,160
I don't know what the
pressure is doing in

671
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,030
there, doing that expansion.

672
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:46,100
It could be quite chaotic.

673
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,900
It could be non-spacially
constant.

674
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,710
OK, so but you still know
a number of things.

675
00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:00,450
We're now going to be able to
write you know dw is minus p

676
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:01,960
dV, but we're still going
to be able to

677
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,520
write a bunch of things.

678
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,890
We're still going to be able to
write that it's an adiabat

679
00:40:05,890 --> 00:40:11,210
so that dq equals zero.

680
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,530
We're still going to be able
to write dw instead of pV

681
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,980
where p is the internal
pressure. dw now is actually

682
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,590
much easier.

683
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,400
It's minus p external.

684
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,650
Well p external is actually p2,
so that makes it actually

685
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:29,070
easier. dV we're still
going to write that

686
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:29,900
it's an ideal gas.

687
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,940
So du is still going to be
equal to Cv dT, and we're

688
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,590
still going to be able to use
the first law, all these

689
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:40,500
things don't matter
where the path is.

690
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,240
Still know that du
is dq plus dw.

691
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:48,390
dq is zero. dw is minus p2 dV.

692
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:51,140
So this is what we know, just
like what we wrote there.

693
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,690
We write what we know.

694
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,610
I'm not going to turn
the crank here.

695
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,340
I'm going to give
you the answer.

696
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:59,320
OK, you use the ideal gas law,
etc., then you get a

697
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,960
relationship that connects the
pressure and the temperature,

698
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,720
like here we got a relationship
that connected

699
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,160
the temperatures and the
volumes together.

700
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,630
You can get a relationship that
connects the temperature

701
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:27,780
so this is T2 times Cv plus R
is equal to T1 on Cv plus p2

702
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:31,810
over p1 times R.

703
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,620
This is going to be the connect,
what connects the

704
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,580
pressures and the temperature.

705
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:43,570
And p2 is less than p1, so
this number right here

706
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,470
is less than 1.

707
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,240
So and Cv plus R, Cv plus
something less than R, so T1

708
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,370
better be bigger than T2.

709
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:57,690
OK, so T2 is less than T1.

710
00:41:57,690 --> 00:41:59,770
Same qualitative result
as before.

711
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:01,270
You have an expansion.

712
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:03,060
It's and adiabatic expansion.

713
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,750
You get a cooling of the gas.

714
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,560
OK?

715
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,290
Now here's a question for you
guys, which we're going to

716
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:18,710
vote on, so you better start
thinking about it.

717
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:26,050
Is the temperature T2 in this
process smaller or larger than

718
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:31,250
if I were to do the process
reversibly with the same

719
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,120
endpoint pressure.

720
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:38,100
So now, instead of having p
external equals to p2 here, I

721
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,970
put p1 and I let this whole
thing go reversibly.

722
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:49,760
And I compare T2 irreversible
to T2 reversible.

723
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,130
They're both less than T1.

724
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:52,400
They're supposed, there's
a cooling

725
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,220
happening in both cases.

726
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:57,410
One is going to be colder
than the other, maybe.

727
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:58,330
Maybe they're going
to be the same.

728
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:58,750
I don't know.

729
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:01,500
I'm going to let you try to
figure that out qualitatively

730
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:03,790
without doing any math.

731
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,230
See if you can figure it out.

732
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:15,540
OK, so which is colder?

733
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,020
I'm going to let you think
about it for about thirty

734
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:35,300
seconds or so.

735
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:37,000
You can talk to each
other if you don't,

736
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:57,000
can't figure it out.

737
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,750
All right, let's take a vote.

738
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:01,750
How many people say that T2
irreversible is colder than T2

739
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:04,240
reversible?

740
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:14,320
One, two, don't be shy, three
four, anybody else, five.

741
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,370
OK, I've got five votes here.

742
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:15,710
Professor Nelson?

743
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,070
PROFESSOR NELSON: Oh,
I'm abstaining.

744
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,190
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: You're
abstaining, OK, good choice.

745
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:27,000
OK, what about T1
cooler than T2?

746
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,590
OK, I've got a lot
of votes here.

747
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:32,300
So the majority of the
people, so this is

748
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,160
much bigger than five.

749
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:35,830
OK.

750
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:37,900
So remember last time the
majority was wrong, right?

751
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,860
The majority was wrong
last time.

752
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,580
That doesn't mean that the
majority is wrong here.

753
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,000
It could be right.

754
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,660
Let me give you another piece
of information here that you

755
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,880
already know.

756
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:54,380
Minus w irreversible, this is
the work which is done to the

757
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,300
environment by the system, minus
w irreversible is always

758
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,900
smaller than minus
w reversible.

759
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,550
You learned that a
little while ago.

760
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:08,630
OK, so this is a little hint.

761
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:09,620
Let's vote again.

762
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:12,520
Let's think about it for ten
seconds why this could be

763
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:19,410
interesting and relevant, and
I want to ask if anybody

764
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:22,740
changed their mind.

765
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,530
Anybody change their mind,
change their vote?

766
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:27,540
Yes You want to change
your vote?

767
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,022
To which one?

768
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:33,224
STUDENT: From T2 reversible is
greater than T2 irreversible,

769
00:45:33,224 --> 00:45:36,280
saying that T2 reversible
is [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

770
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:37,440
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: So
the question then,

771
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,482
which one is colder?

772
00:45:40,482 --> 00:45:42,447
STUDENT: T2 reversible
should be colder.

773
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:44,750
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: T2
irreversible should be colder?

774
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:47,710
STUDENT: Yes.

775
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:49,600
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: All right.

776
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,710
OK.

777
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,690
I'm going to keep you there
then, the majority.

778
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:52,900
Yes?

779
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,810
STUDENT: I'm switching
to [INAUDIBLE].

780
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,720
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: You're
switching this way here?

781
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,460
So now we have six here.

782
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:04,840
Anybody else want to switch?

783
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,700
All right, let's take the
example of, the extreme

784
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:12,350
example, let's go to the
extreme example where p

785
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:17,250
external is really small.

786
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:22,180
And I have this adiabatic
expansion where p external is

787
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,030
really small. it's kind
of like the Joule

788
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,850
expansion, an ideal gas.

789
00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:32,240
What happened to the temperature
in a Joule

790
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,310
expansion in ideal gas?

791
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:37,340
Anybody remember?

792
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,860
Anybody remember?

793
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:44,800
Joule expansion, this is where
we proved that delta u was

794
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,130
only dependent on temperature.

795
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:51,780
Bob Field taught that lecture.

796
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,740
Nobody remembers?

797
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:56,430
Well, all right, delta u is
equal to zero for that.

798
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,960
What happened to the temperature
in that expansion?

799
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,080
It's an adiabatic expansion.

800
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:04,980
Well, we'll revisit that.

801
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,520
Let me ask you another
question here.

802
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,920
So w, the work is less for the
irreversible process than the

803
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,190
reversible process.

804
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:14,960
There's less work done
to the outside.

805
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,080
So there's less energy expanded
by the system.

806
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,070
The energy expanded by the
system is smaller for the

807
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:23,240
irreversible process.

808
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,150
It's not doing as much work.

809
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,410
It's not pressing against
as much pressure.

810
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,550
Right? p external equals
p2 is less than p

811
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,300
external equals p internal.

812
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,080
So it doesn't have to
do as much work.

813
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,400
It doesn't have to expend as
much energy, therefore, the

814
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,680
majority in this
case is right.

815
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:43,710
The temperature is not going
to cool as much for the

816
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:44,640
irreversible process.

817
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,710
The reversible process is going
to be colder because it

818
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:48,000
has to expend more energy.

819
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,840
It's going to have a
higher pressure.

820
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,460
The pressure is going to
decrease along the way, but

821
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,090
it's going to have to
do more work because

822
00:47:56,090 --> 00:47:57,260
of this right here.

823
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,850
So the majority in this
case is right.

824
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,680
Now the Joule expansion, the
temperature doesn't change, T

825
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:08,440
equals zero. eta sub J, the
Joule coefficient for an ideal

826
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:17,380
gas, is equal to zero and
eta sub J was dT/dV

827
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,210
under constant energy.

828
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:23,340
All right, any questions?

829
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:23,730
Yes?

830
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:29,980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

831
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,660
PROFESSOR BAWENDI: The only
-- a priori, that's true.

832
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,800
But it's hard to imagine an
irreversible compression the

833
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:44,540
way we can just imagine an
irreversible expansion.

834
00:48:44,540 --> 00:48:47,350
You have to do it awfully fast
to get your irreversible

835
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:47,800
compression.

836
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,790
I don't know how to
do it really.

837
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:54,720
I think it's, but it's more
complicated, but you're

838
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,230
basically right, basically
right.

839
00:48:57,230 --> 00:48:59,880
That's why we always talk about
irreversible expansion,

840
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,210
because it's easy
to write down an

841
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:02,330
irreversible expansion.

842
00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:04,680
A compression is a little
bit more complicated.

843
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:08,540
Any other questions?

844
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,680
OK, great.

845
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:15,450
Monday Professor Nelson who is
sitting here will be taking

846
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:18,160
over for a few weeks
and then you'll see

847
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,170
me again after that.
