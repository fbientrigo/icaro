8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,530
PROFESSOR NELSON: Well, today
we're going to continue with

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:29,200
the lecture that was started
last time that had the

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,830
scintillating and descriptive
title "some thermodynamic

11
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,250
processes".

12
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,490
And we're going to continue
along those lines, and really

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,720
there a couple of things that I
want to do to follow up what

14
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,000
you saw last time.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,150
One is that you've got
introduced and led through a

16
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,250
couple of elementary
thermodynamic cycles.

17
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,830
And I want to do a little
bit more of that today.

18
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,990
And one of the -- there are
really two reasons.

19
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,650
One is that as you saw last
time doing a thermodynamic

20
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:02,570
cycle can be extremely useful,
because if you have one path

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,800
along which some change occurs,
but along which it's

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,670
not necessarily easy to
calculate all of the

23
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,710
thermodynamic changes along
such a path, it may be

24
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:16,450
irreversible, lots of variables
may change.

25
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,850
It can be easier instead of
looking at the complicated

26
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,810
path to devise a cycle that
involves several easier steps,

27
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,520
each one of which is facile for
the calculation of what

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,730
happens to the thermodynamic
properties.

29
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,310
So in that case, it's much
easier to go through several

30
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:42,730
elementary step, and then the
one complicated path you know

31
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:46,140
because going around the entire
cycle state functions,

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,240
you know that they won't
have any change.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,020
So in that sense, going through
a thermodynamic cycle

34
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,920
can be useful because it
helps you calculate

35
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,930
thermodynamic qualities.

36
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,290
But the other reason to go
through the thermodynamic

37
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,380
cycles and really to develop
great facility with them is

38
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:06,680
because there are just an awful
lot of things in nature

39
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,300
and things that we build that
run in cycles, where we want

40
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,090
to calculate the thermodynamics,
right.

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,140
If we build an engine for a
car or anything else, it

42
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,720
almost always is going to have
some key element that's

43
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,560
operating in a cycle,
otherwise it

44
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,700
won't keep going, right.

45
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,590
But it's not just engines
that we might build.

46
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,390
It's biological engines,
right.

47
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,680
Things that either produce or
consume biological fuel to do

48
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,180
different sorts of processes.

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,290
Also, of course of key
importance to understand what

50
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,810
the, in that case, biological
thermodynamics are.

51
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:44,550
And again, there'll be key
elements that run in cycles

52
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,110
and understanding those can
be extremely important in

53
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,180
understanding how cellular
function works.

54
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,260
OK, so what I'd like to do is go
through one cycle, and then

55
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,540
I'll suggest another for you to
work through on your own.

56
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:02,930
So consistent with the title
of the lecture, we've got a

57
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:05,910
section from your last lecture
notes entitled "some

58
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,980
thermodynamic cycles".

59
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:14,260
And what we're going to do is
go through a cycle, please

60
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,150
note these office hours and
locations, which I think

61
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,200
wasn't specified before.

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:33,170
So we're going to go through
a thermodynamic cycle, and

63
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:37,630
here's what I want to calculate
when we do this.

64
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:43,610
Delta u, delta H, familiar state
functions, changes in

65
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:51,230
their values, q, w,
heat and work.

66
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,990
And I also want to introduce
one new function.

67
00:03:55,990 --> 00:04:00,950
I won't give it a name yet,
but it's going to have the

68
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:15,500
unusual form dq over
T. OK, we'll

69
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:22,620
call it special function.

70
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:28,350
It's so special that we'll
call this quantity dS.

71
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:34,475
OK, we'll just go through this
on a whim, and this is going

72
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:37,960
to be foreshadowing something
that'll take on tremendous

73
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:40,470
importance in subsequent
lectures, but I'm going to use

74
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,580
the opportunity now to just
introduce the behavior of it

75
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,650
in going around a cycle.

76
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:49,780
If that's for me, tell
them I'm busy please.

77
00:04:49,780 --> 00:05:01,840
OK, so let's look at the
cycle we'll go through.

78
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,100
We're going to look at pressure
volume changes,

79
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,990
similar to what you
saw before.

80
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:19,960
This time, we're going to have
initial and final volumes, V1

81
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,990
and V2 and different pressures
where we might end up.

82
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:31,130
And we're going to look
at two ways to go to a

83
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:35,840
final volume V2.

84
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,740
One of them is going to end up
at pressure p2 and the other

85
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,580
is going to end up
at pressure p3.

86
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:50,010
One of them is going to be a
reversible isothermal path.

87
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:56,060
This is going to be our path
we'll label A, reversible

88
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:05,950
isothermal which is to say
constant T, right?

89
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,860
And we're going to start at
temperature T1, so since it's

90
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,940
constant temperature, this
is going to end up

91
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:15,490
at temperature T1.

92
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,480
And then we're also going
to consider a reversible

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,760
adiabatic path.

94
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:36,820
This'll be our path B,
reversible adiabatic.

95
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,410
And then we'll close this
circle, this cycle.

96
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,080
This is going to end
up at a different

97
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,140
temperature by the way.

98
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,140
You saw this last time in a
slightly different way.

99
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,600
Last time what you saw is we
compared isothermal and

100
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,720
adiabatic paths that ended up
at the same final pressure,

101
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,650
and what you saw is that
therefore, they ended up in

102
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,460
different final volumes.

103
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,590
So this is just a little bit
different from that.

104
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,560
So this is going to end up at a
different temperature, we'll

105
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,380
call it T2.

106
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,740
And then we're going
to close the cycle.

107
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,010
And so this is a constant
volume path then.

108
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:19,030
This is path C, constant
volume.

109
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,280
OK?

110
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,540
So now let's go around the cycle
and just compare notes

111
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,400
on what happens to
the thermodynamic

112
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,660
quantities as we do that.

113
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:39,960
So here's path A,
it's isothermal.

114
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,610
And I didn't specify, but let's
make sure to do so,

115
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:52,740
we've got a, it's going
to be an ideal gas.

116
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,790
OK, so A is constant
temperature.

117
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:07,890
What does that mean for
delta u in path A?

118
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:10,010
Zero right?

119
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,870
Ideal gas, no temperature
change, right has to be zero

120
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:19,920
because da is Cv dT for an ideal
gas. dT is zero, there's

121
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,800
no temperature change.

122
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:31,540
OK, how about delta H, zero
Cp dT for an ideal gas.

123
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,530
dT is zero.

124
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:37,370
All right, now, it's
reversible.

125
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:41,570
So that means we can immediately
write down an

126
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:45,170
expression for the work.

127
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:53,960
Since it's reversible, it's
negative p dV right?

128
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:00,810
And since it's an ideal gas then
we can replace p, right,

129
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,010
with RT over V, right?

130
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,500
We want to do that because we
have too many variables here.

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,130
We've already got dV we'll get
rid of p as an additional

132
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,590
variable and replace it with
V which is already in here.

133
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:27,520
So it's minus R T1
dV over V, right?

134
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,060
I can put in T1 because we're a
constant temperature. so now

135
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,260
we can just integrate straight
away and find that the work in

136
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:44,160
path A it's just the integral
of that quantity minus

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:54,430
integral of R T1 going from V1
to V2 dV over V. so it's minus

138
00:09:54,430 --> 00:10:02,550
R T1 log V2 over V1.

139
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,070
All right, so let's just do
a reality check here.

140
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,550
The way I've got this
drawn, the volume is

141
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,880
going up in the process.

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,210
It's an expansion.

143
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:17,660
So is this system doing work
on the surroundings, or are

144
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:25,730
the surroundings doing
work on the system?

145
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,230
Somebody say it real loud.

146
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:32,210
Yes, the system is working on
the surroundings, right?

147
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:34,810
It's pushing out against them.

148
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:37,890
Work is defined as the work that
the surroundings do on

149
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,760
the system.

150
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,660
So this is the negative
number, right?

151
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,250
V2 is bigger than V1.

152
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,060
This is positive.

153
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,650
This whole thing is negative.

154
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:56,220
All right, q has to be just the
opposite of this because

155
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,870
we've already figured out that
there's no change in u.

156
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,470
This is just q plus w.

157
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:12,520
There's w, q has to be R
T1 log of V2 over V1.

158
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:20,960
OK, so that means heat is being
imparted to the system,

159
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,170
right, from the surroundings in
a manner that compensates

160
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:28,780
exactly the amount
of work done.

161
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,350
OK, All right, so these are the
thermodynamic quantities

162
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:36,010
that you're familiar
with already.

163
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:43,420
Let's just quickly look at
our special function.

164
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,320
It's not going to be hard to
calculate because it's a

165
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,550
constant temperature path,
so that T in the

166
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,280
bottom is just T1, right.

167
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:55,060
You've already looked
at q, right.

168
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:20,830
So dq A over T1 it's just
R log V2 over V1 right.

169
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,470
So there's our special
function for

170
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,980
this particular path.

171
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:41,770
OK, so that's path A. Now let's
compare to path B. So if

172
00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:49,260
path B is an adibat, what's
zero? q, it's adiabatic, that

173
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:52,470
means there's no heat exchanged
between the system

174
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,040
and the surroundings.

175
00:12:54,040 --> 00:13:08,480
So what happens, q B is zero.

176
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,600
There is a change in
temperature, right?

177
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,650
We've got, if we say it's a mole
of gas, it's going from

178
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:32,450
p1, V1, and T1 to one mole of
our gas at p3, V2, and T2.

179
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,560
So unlike before now

180
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,920
temperature is going to change.

181
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,680
So that means that delta
u isn't zero this time.

182
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,140
du, it's an ideal gas.

183
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:52,110
So this is Cv dT and of course
we can just integrate this

184
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,370
straight away.

185
00:13:53,370 --> 00:14:09,740
So delta u B is Cv times T2
minus T1, right. and similarly

186
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:15,730
dH is Cp dT right.

187
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:29,940
So delta H in pathway B is
just Cp T2 minus T1 okay?

188
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,040
All right, what we've already
got that q is zero.

189
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,860
Delta u is q plus w.

190
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:37,340
Delta u isn't zero.

191
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:49,780
So this must be equal
to work, right?

192
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,680
And now we can look at our
special function, but since

193
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:58,840
this is zero right dq B is zero,
along path B, so our

194
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:09,594
special function, dS, so we're
going to go, dq B over T is

195
00:15:09,594 --> 00:15:12,330
equal to zero.

196
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:21,450
OK?

197
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:27,400
OK, finally let's look at our
third path, this constant

198
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:33,540
volume path, that's going to
connect T1 and T2, right?

199
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:41,450
Constant volume, what's zero?

200
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:41,800
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

201
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,460
PROFESSOR NELSON: A little
more noise here.

202
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,160
What's zero?

203
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,270
STUDENT: Work.

204
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,170
PROFESSOR NELSON: Work, great.

205
00:15:50,170 --> 00:16:02,260
So, path C constant volume means
our work in past C is

206
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,420
zero, right?

207
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:11,680
Now, our temperature is going
to change from T2 to T1, and

208
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,170
we just saw what happens to u
and H when that happens going

209
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,840
from T1 to T2, and it's
no different.

210
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,410
It's an ideal gas going
along these path.

211
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:25,150
So we can immediately write
delta u C is Cv

212
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,190
times T1 minus T2.

213
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:40,220
Delta Hc C is Cp times
T1 minus T2, right?

214
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,580
Work is zero.

215
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,390
Delta u is w plus q,
work plus heat.

216
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,540
This is zero, this isn't.

217
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:55,550
This must be heat q B, right.

218
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,980
So again, there are our
familiar thermodynamic

219
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,300
quantities, but now let's also
look at our special function.

220
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,080
It's not going to be zero this
time because we have non zero

221
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,090
heat exchange between
the system and the

222
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,990
environment, right.

223
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:25,980
So are integral of dq C over T,
right, which is our heat,

224
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,700
but in this case we can do
this calculation easily

225
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:36,960
because since work is zero, we
can equate dq with du, right.

226
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:44,240
So we can write this as our
integral from T1 to T2, du

227
00:17:44,240 --> 00:18:06,330
over T. du is just
Cv dT, right.

228
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:15,480
So this is just Cv
log T2 over T1.

229
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,510
OK?

230
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:26,750
So now we've completed
the cycle.

231
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,280
So let's just compare.

232
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,510
Let's compare what happened in
path A to what happened in

233
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:43,030
paths B and C. Yes?

234
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,740
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

235
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:46,250
PROFESSOR NELSON: Ah sorry,
yes of course.

236
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:56,360
Thank you.

237
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:04,630
Yes, oh yes, so.

238
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

239
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,600
PROFESSOR NELSON: And it's
right because, thank you

240
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,930
again, it's because we're
going from T1 to T2.

241
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:17,270
So I'm getting confused
by the oh sorry, we're

242
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:20,880
going from T2 to T1.

243
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,810
So it's in reverse of the order
of the subscripts and I

244
00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:27,850
let this confuse me.

245
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,870
There it is.

246
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:37,510
There it is.

247
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,200
There.

248
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,670
Thank you, any other details
which should be pointed out?

249
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,150
All right, then let's proceed.

250
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,670
So what we're going to do is
our comparison of what

251
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,790
happened on pathway A to what
happened in combined pathways

252
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,780
B and C, right?

253
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:07,700
So here are results for pathway
A, right, for delta u

254
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,850
zero delta H zero.

255
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:18,210
I didn't actually explicitly
write it or did I?

256
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:20,440
Let's just write it again.

257
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,133
Here's our work in path A, and
here's our heat exchange in

258
00:20:27,133 --> 00:20:40,820
path A. Now let's look at the
sum of B and C. So B plus C,

259
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:48,210
here is delta uB Cv
times T2 minus T1.

260
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:57,380
Delta uC Cv times T1 minus T2,
the sum is zero right.

261
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,840
That's the some of delta u in
these two paths, and if we

262
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,390
look at delta u in just
path A, it's zero.

263
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,660
And it's going to be the same
without delta H. The only

264
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:12,920
difference is it'll be Cp
instead of Cv, but there it is

265
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:18,110
for pathway B. There it is for
a pathway C. So the state

266
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:22,250
functions that we're familiar
with are doing what we expect

267
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,470
they ought to be doing, right?

268
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,830
If you go around in a cycle,
starting and ending at the

269
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,730
same place, the state functions

270
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,660
have to stay the same.

271
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,890
They only depend on the state
the system is in.

272
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,320
They don't depend on the
path, and that's what

273
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,150
we've shown, right.

274
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,320
Similarly if we go from this
point to this point through

275
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,290
path A or if we do it through
the combination of these two

276
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,790
paths, and the change in u and H
in any state function, those

277
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:49,660
have to be the same.

278
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:52,990
It turns out they're zero in
both cases, and that's what

279
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:56,260
we've seen, right?

280
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:01,360
Now let's compare what happens
to work and heat.

281
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,160
So here are expressions
for work and heat.

282
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:12,615
They're opposites for the
pathway A. Here's pathway B

283
00:22:12,615 --> 00:22:17,960
and C. In C the work is zero.

284
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:24,920
In B it isn't, it's Cv times
T2 minus T1, right.

285
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,910
The work isn't equal to the
work in pathway A, right,

286
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:35,050
because you know work is not a
state function it depends on

287
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:39,890
the path right, and there are
different amounts of work done

288
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,420
on the system, or done by the
system on the surroundings in

289
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,190
these two different processes.

290
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,150
They're both expansions.

291
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:50,510
They'll both have net work done
on the surroundings, but

292
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,080
not the same amount, right.

293
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,830
And of course it's going to
be the same with heat.

294
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:58,360
We've already seen that
delta u is zero.

295
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,920
So we know that in each case
the heat is going to be the

296
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,050
opposite of the work, but the
work isn't the same in these

297
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:08,950
two different ways of getting
from here to here, right.

298
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,640
So let's just see
it explicitly.

299
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,340
Here's our qA.

300
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:18,460
Here's heat exchanged in pathway
A and in pathway B

301
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:23,810
heat is zero, and in pathway
C, here is qC

302
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:27,110
it's Cv T1 minus T2.

303
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,980
So again, for both heat
and work we don't

304
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,570
get the same result.

305
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:36,630
Now let's look at our special
function, right.

306
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:42,670
So here's path A. We found that
it's R log V2 over V1.

307
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:49,770
Pathway B is zero.

308
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:53,620
Pathway C it's Cv
log T1 over T2.

309
00:23:53,620 --> 00:24:08,930
All right, let's just look at
that a little more carefully.

310
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,500
R log V2 over V1.

311
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:31,940
B plus C, Cv log of
T1 over T2, right.

312
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:37,340
Just some weird combination
of functions, right?

313
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:42,550
But, of course, it's not
quite like that.

314
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,410
Why?

315
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:50,520
Because this path is
an adiabatic path.

316
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,530
And you already saw last time
there was this relationship

317
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:59,360
between the temperature and
volume changes along an

318
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,000
adiabatic path.

319
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,620
So let me just write
that down.

320
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:16,830
Adiabatic reversible path.

321
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:27,110
What you saw is that T1 over
T2 was V2 over V1 to the

322
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:32,310
power R over Cv.

323
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:36,340
Isn't that something?

324
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,780
So what does that mean?

325
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,590
We take this Cv and put in
the exponent here, right.

326
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:50,290
And we put this R up in
the exponent here.

327
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,740
What are we going to discover?

328
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:58,790
Those two things are equal
right, T1 over T2 to the power

329
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:10,380
Cv is V2 over V1 to the power R,
so dS over path A equals dS

330
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,570
over paths B plus C, okay?

331
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:23,120
So what this suggests is that
whatever this funny special

332
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,700
function is, at least for this
one cycle that we've, tried

333
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,440
it's behaving like a state
function, right.

334
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,400
It seems like its change
is independent of path.

335
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,970
Start here, end up here, do
it through two different

336
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,480
pathways, end up in the
same place, right.

337
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,120
OK, now that's all the
foreshadowing I'm going to

338
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,220
give it for right now.

339
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:53,500
We will certainly come
back to this very

340
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,720
special function shortly.

341
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
Before I move on, I'm just
going to put on the board

342
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,250
another cycle, and I'm going
to urge you to work through

343
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:05,080
that on your own.

344
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,230
It's worked through already,
let's see, I believe it's

345
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:17,720
worked through in
the notes, yes.

346
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,210
So if you need the help of the
notes it's in there, but I

347
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,020
would urge you to work through
it on your own, and it's the

348
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:49,190
following: let's start with the
same path A, all right?

349
00:27:49,190 --> 00:28:00,480
So we've got our reversible
adiabatic path right.

350
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:06,190
And now, try working through
what happens if we close the

351
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,530
cycle in a different way,
right, like this.

352
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:18,310
So here's a path that's constant
pressure, and here is

353
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:24,140
a path that's constant volume,
similar to the constant volume

354
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,280
path that we did before, but
not between the same

355
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,440
pressures, right.

356
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,460
So we can label this one D and
this one E, and I urge you to

357
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:41,500
just try going through that
and verifying for yourself

358
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,760
that again the state functions
will behave the way state

359
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,760
functions should, and you can
see whether this special

360
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,880
function once again behaves like
a state function, right.

361
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,270
And of course you should expect
to see that the work

362
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,540
and the heat again won't behave
like state functions

363
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,850
which they are, then you'll see
you have different results

364
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,420
for those, depending
on the path, OK?

365
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:12,140
Any questions about going
through these cycles and using

366
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:16,770
expressions like this
and so forth?

367
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:20,310
Expressions like this you know
turn up in various places,

368
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,980
like in the equations sheet
that appears at the end of

369
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,650
exams, right?

370
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,960
Which means that you
may not need to be

371
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,410
committing it to memory.

372
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:33,080
On the other hand it means that
you should, it's the sort

373
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,490
of thing that you should be
familiar with so that the need

374
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:40,610
to use it is something that
you'll conjure when you're

375
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,260
working on a problem and there's
a reversible adiabat,

376
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:46,870
and you have temperatures and
volumes that change that you

377
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:53,170
might like to relate
to each other.

378
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,750
Cycles that are suggested that
you go through and aren't gone

379
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:59,350
through in class also sometimes
turn up on exams

380
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,770
too, by the way.

381
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:06,270
So that said, let's move on to
the next topic, which is

382
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,180
thermochemistry.

383
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:14,170
So, so far what you've seen in
most of the examples in the

384
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:19,080
class are essentially mechanical
kinds of changes,

385
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,240
pressure volume sorts of
changes, where the system is

386
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,960
doing essentially a kind of
mechanical work, pressure

387
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,580
volume work on the surroundings
or vice versa and

388
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:31,110
heat is being exchanged, and
you're calculating the basic

389
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,385
thermodynamics just like
we went through, of

390
00:30:33,385 --> 00:30:36,250
processes of that sort.

391
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,230
Now I'd like to start
introducing something that's

392
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,760
really central to chemical
thermodynamics, mainly

393
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,420
chemistry, right.

394
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,550
Let's start looking at chemical
reactions, right, and

395
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:53,870
understanding what the changes
in thermodynamic properties

396
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,170
are that occur when chemical
reactions occur, and the

397
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,490
immediate application is to
calculate the change in

398
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:04,480
enthalpy, which, as you've seen
it, at constant pressure

399
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,200
which is the condition under
which an awful lot of

400
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,420
chemistry is done, that's
just the heat.

401
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,755
Which means we're going
to calculate heats

402
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:16,310
of reaction, right.

403
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,520
You're running some reaction.

404
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,260
It's in the atmosphere.

405
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,140
It's at constant pressure.

406
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,220
You know, you mix acid and base
together and the thing

407
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,400
heats up like crazy, right.

408
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,600
Or other things might
react spontaneously.

409
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,700
You can feel something
cooling off right.

410
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,155
I mean simple examples of these
happen when you, you

411
00:31:34,155 --> 00:31:36,350
know, if you buy cold
or hot packs.

412
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,940
You break the seal between them
and feel the thing get

413
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,780
cold, for example, right.

414
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,770
What's happening there?

415
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:46,730
Well, the selection of reactants
has been done

416
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,680
judiciously to provide either
heat or to provide something

417
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,890
that's cool.

418
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,530
And all of that is coming out
of the heat of reaction,

419
00:31:56,530 --> 00:31:59,450
whether it's positive
or negative.

420
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,130
Of course the biggest practical
application is

421
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:04,580
burning of fuel.

422
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:08,570
You might use the heat to, and
convert it into pressure

423
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,640
volume work, right?

424
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,060
So if it's an internal
combustion

425
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,870
engine, you'll do a reaction.

426
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,820
There will be the heat
of reaction.

427
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,640
There'll be a volume change,
depending on the conditions

428
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,990
under which is occurs, and you
can extract work through the

429
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:24,500
reaction and so forth.

430
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,410
So let's just to see how you
run through some of those

431
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,350
calculations.

432
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:34,120
Now let me just ask who
here took 5.111?

433
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,910
And who here took 5.112?

434
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:43,950
OK, now you've seen some
thermal chemistry

435
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:46,040
in 5.111 and 5.112.

436
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,590
So I I'm going to do some review
of that, but I'm also

437
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,270
going to call on the
thermochemistry that I'm

438
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,700
pretty sure you're
familiar with.

439
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:58,000
So I won't go painstakingly
over every element of the

440
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,830
notes here.

441
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:02,350
Subsequently we'll go on into
additional topics that you

442
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:24,520
haven't seen, and I'll treat
them in full detail.

443
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:33,690
OK, so let's do some
thermochemistry.

444
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:39,910
What we want to do is we'd like
to be able to predict for

445
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,720
any reaction what's the
heat of reaction.

446
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:59,140
And so what we're going to
calculator is delta H. So for

447
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,920
any kind of reaction we should
be able to do that, right?

448
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:09,080
And we're going to treat
constant pressure situations

449
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:17,090
certainly at first and most
of the time, right?

450
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:32,030
Constant pressure, right,
reversible delta H is going to

451
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:37,840
give us our heat of
reaction, OK.

452
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:44,600
And then if we can also
determine delta u, then we

453
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,412
know this, we know delta u
is q plus w, then we can

454
00:34:50,412 --> 00:35:07,710
determine work as well, right?

455
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:14,270
And typically, we'll be treating
at least some cases

456
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:16,670
where we're dealing with ideal
gases in which case we can

457
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:20,160
easily get delta u.

458
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,080
And then we'll be able
to in a very

459
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,960
straightforward way get w.

460
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,030
So it's a really powerful and
simple formalism, once we set

461
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,050
up what is needed the go
through it, right?

462
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:56,400
So let's just consider
any reaction.

463
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,300
The one that I've got written
down for you is it's the

464
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,070
reverse of the rusting
of iron, right?

465
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:07,390
So iron left to own devices in
the atmosphere in the presence

466
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,210
of a little bit of water, and
the atmosphere will start

467
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,970
combining with the water
form iron oxide.

468
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,810
There's an equilibrium
between the two.

469
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:19,830
So we'll have an iron
oxide species.

470
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:27,740
It's a solid.

471
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:38,110
It's combining with hydrogen
which is a gas to give iron,

472
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:49,180
also a solid and water, right?

473
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:52,110
So the way I've written this
we're imagining the iron, the

474
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:57,020
solid iron immersed in the water
as a liquid, could be

475
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,510
calculated otherwise as well,
but in this case were imaging

476
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,810
the water as liquid and going
in this direction then it's

477
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:12,390
forming iron oxide and evolving
hydrogen gas, okay?

478
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:21,690
And our heat of reaction or
enthalpy of reaction is

479
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:26,190
defined as the enthalpy
at constant pressure.

480
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,410
Isothermal conditions,
temperature won't change and

481
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:38,480
reversible work.

482
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:49,850
For Isothermal reaction
constant

483
00:37:49,850 --> 00:38:00,230
pressure reversible, right?

484
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,390
Of course, they're all sorts
of conditions under which a

485
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,640
reaction could be wrong
in the lab or

486
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,330
outdoors or however, right.

487
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:09,350
But this is the way
we're going to

488
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:11,650
define delta H of reaction.

489
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:13,830
We want to have that definition
clear because in

490
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,750
fact we're going to, we might
want tabulate heats of

491
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,360
reaction, right, and of course
want to know what the

492
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:23,980
conditions are for the tabulated
values apply.

493
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,050
And we're going to want to
calculate them from other

494
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:28,300
quantities, and again, we're
going to need to know each

495
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,790
case what are the relevant
conditions?

496
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:37,090
OK, so what happens?

497
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:40,910
Well, we should be
able to get this.

498
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:44,100
We should be able to
calculate delta H.

499
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,770
It's a state function.

500
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:55,410
If we know the enthalpy of the
products minus the enthalpy of

501
00:38:55,410 --> 00:39:00,520
the reactants, right.

502
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:05,400
It's a state function.

503
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,280
And we can we can do this in
principle except for one

504
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:14,450
important detail, which is
that enthalpy, just like

505
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:19,120
energy u isn't measured on an
absolute scale but on a

506
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,550
relative scale, right?

507
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:24,310
You know, if you want to measure
the potential energy

508
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,820
of something in a gravitational
field, you have

509
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,090
to define the zero somewhere,
right, because it's arbitrary.

510
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,120
You can set it anywhere
you want.

511
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,030
It's the same with enthalpy.

512
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:39,890
Enthalpy is just u plus p V. So
there is an arbitrary set

513
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,690
point that needs to
be defined, right?

514
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:47,250
Because what you actually
measure in the lab are changes

515
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:51,420
in enthalpy, just like what you
measure when you look at

516
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:54,350
energy change of some sort,
you measure the change in

517
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,960
energy, right.

518
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,010
The absolute number that you
assign to it is something

519
00:39:59,010 --> 00:39:59,880
that's arbitrary.

520
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:03,260
You have to set what
the zero is.

521
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,450
And so there's a well-understood
convention for

522
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:09,010
what the zero is.

523
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:17,290
What we define as zero is the
enthalpy of every element in

524
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,310
its natural state at room

525
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,560
temperature and ambient pressure.

526
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:26,780
In other words, we choose a
convention for the zero of

527
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,330
entropy, so that then we can
write entropies of products

528
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:35,660
and reactants always referring
to the same standard state.

529
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:41,920
And then we calculate changes,
the convention is understood

530
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,330
with respect to what
is the zero, right.

531
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:48,800
And so our tabulated values,
they'll all work.

532
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,000
They'll all refer to the
same standard state.

533
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,230
And we'll be able to use the
formalism that we set up.

534
00:40:55,230 --> 00:41:36,030
So our reference point for H,
it's 298.15 Kelvin, one bar

535
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:44,730
and in that standard state our
molar enthalpy is defined as

536
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:59,260
zero for every element
in its stable form.

537
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:05,410
OK, very important.

538
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:14,450
OK, now, given that reference
point, all we need to do to

539
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,870
get the value of enthalpy that
we're going to use for each

540
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:25,280
reactant and each product is
calculate how much does the

541
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,730
enthalpy change to form it from
the elements in their

542
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:33,370
stable form at room temperature

543
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:37,540
and pressure, right.

544
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:42,160
So we're going to replace the H
or we're going to put in for

545
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,050
the H what we'll call our heat
of formation or delta H of

546
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,260
formation starting from the
elements in their stable

547
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,580
states at room temperature
and pressure, for

548
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,500
each of these things.

549
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:57,440
And we can do that because now
we're going to have instead of

550
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,650
just sort of H, it's going to
be delta H of formation for

551
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:03,570
each of these things, is going
to appear in our calculation

552
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:06,040
of H, but that's OK.

553
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,310
Delta H of formation means the
enthalpy of this compound

554
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:16,720
minus the enthalpy of its
constituent elements in their

555
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,440
most stable state at room
temperature and pressure.

556
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,160
But we've defined the enthalpy
of those elements in their

557
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,930
stable state at room temperature
and pressure as

558
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,800
zero, right?

559
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,930
So we're just subtracting, in
effect, zero, right, from the

560
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,160
enthalpy of the product, but of
course it's important have

561
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,070
that established because the
heat of formation is something

562
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:42,120
you could measure, right?

563
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:46,050
You could run the reaction,
take solid iron, gaseous

564
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:51,880
oxygen, form iron oxide, measure
the heat of formation

565
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,680
of it, tabulate it.

566
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,420
We know it.

567
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:58,440
We know it forever, right.

568
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,080
And for any of the
other compounds.

569
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,960
So in other words, by defining
that reference state, we can

570
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:11,390
then figure out or measure heats
of formation of a vast

571
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,370
number of compounds.

572
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:14,450
We can tabulate them.

573
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:17,250
We can know them, and then when
we have reactions that

574
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,920
inter-convert different
compounds, we can calculate

575
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:23,256
the heat of reaction is just
the difference between the

576
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:26,260
heat of formation of the
reactants, and the heat of

577
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:30,720
formation of the products,
right.

578
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:37,300
So let's just write that out.

579
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:48,080
So first of all, for example,
right, molar enthalpy of

580
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:57,950
hydrogen gas at 298.15
K is zero.

581
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:03,310
Hydrogen gas it's in its most
stable state, right at room

582
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,470
temperature and pressure.

583
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:10,370
That little zero, that
little superscript

584
00:45:10,370 --> 00:45:17,290
means one bar always.

585
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:17,810
OK.

586
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:33,750
A molar enthalpy of or whatever,
iron, as a solid at

587
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,030
298.15 Kelvin is zero.

588
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:42,660
Iron as an element is a solid.

589
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:45,220
That's it's most stable state
at room temperature and

590
00:45:45,220 --> 00:45:52,580
pressure, right, and so on.

591
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,290
And then we can figure out
heats of formation.

592
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:59,440
Now in this particular reaction,
I've got hydrogen

593
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,290
gas, iron solid.

594
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:07,380
Those already are elements in
their most stable forms at

595
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,200
room temperature and pressure.

596
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,880
But this is a compound, right,
it has some non-zero heat of

597
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:16,400
formation from the elements.

598
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,940
So is water, right?

599
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:23,470
So I need to find out the heats
of formation of the iron

600
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:26,500
oxide and the water.

601
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:29,470
And if I do that then I can
find out the change in

602
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:31,120
enthalpy of this reaction.

603
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,440
It's just going to be the heat
of formation of these three

604
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,990
moles of water, minus
the heat of

605
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,180
formation of the iron oxide.

606
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:48,340
OK.

607
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,270
So how am I going to do that?

608
00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:54,920
Well, I need to write the
reaction that forms that

609
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:57,220
compound from it's
elements, right?

610
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,930
And I want to tabulate that
for an enormous number of

611
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:02,890
materials, right?

612
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:10,160
So for example, if I want to
look at HBr, there's a simple

613
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:18,640
case, right, hydrogen bromine.

614
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,480
What's my heat of formation?

615
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:22,900
Delta Hf.

616
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:28,420
It's going to have our
little zero, right?

617
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,610
How do I calculate it?

618
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:33,040
Well, I need to write the
reaction that forms this from

619
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:36,140
its constituent elements.

620
00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:36,960
What is it?

621
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:48,010
Well, 1/2 H2 as a gas,
temperature, at one bar, plus

622
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:56,390
1/2 bromine, no actually bromine
is a liquid at room

623
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,430
temperature and one
atmosphere.

624
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:07,440
They form HBr which is a gas
at room temperature and one

625
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,050
bar, right.

626
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:17,370
I can measure that.

627
00:48:17,370 --> 00:48:25,220
And the heat of reaction for
this, delta H of reaction is

628
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:36,520
equal to delta H of formation,
of HBr as a gas at our

629
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:42,500
temperature and one bar, okay?

630
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,900
So that's how we determine
our heats of formation.

631
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:53,670
We measure them for all
these compounds.

632
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:58,570
And then we go back to reactions
like this, and we

633
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:12,330
can just very simply determine
the heat of reaction because

634
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:26,350
all we're doing is the
following cycle.

635
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:37,180
We go from reactants to products
and there's some heat

636
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:42,960
of reaction, and here's the
cycle that we have.

637
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,790
We go to the elements
in their standard

638
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:57,460
states, in both cases.

639
00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:10,000
So we're really just doing our
delta H is the negative sum of

640
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,260
delta H of formation for the
reactants, all right?

641
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:23,330
Because here what we're doing
is we're going to take apart

642
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:27,210
our reactants and form the
elements from them, right?

643
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:29,880
So written this way, for
example, I'm going to pull

644
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,460
these things apart, and I'm
going to have solid iron, and

645
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,270
I'm going to have gaseous
oxygen, and I know the

646
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,780
enthalpy of that reaction.

647
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:42,005
That's just given by the heat of
formation, the enthalpy of

648
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:43,060
formation of iron oxide.

649
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:50,680
Here, now I'm going to take
those same elements, and I'm

650
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,610
going to make the
products, right.

651
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,180
I know it's going to work
because I already had this

652
00:50:54,180 --> 00:50:56,370
reaction, so all the, you know,
I'm going to conserve

653
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:59,380
atoms in the right way.

654
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:03,780
So here, I'm going to have delta
H, is just the sum for

655
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:10,500
all the products of delta heat
of formation, right?

656
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Here I'm going to put together
all the products.

657
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:19,830
So this is a positive
heat of formation.

658
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:22,560
This is the negative heat
of formation, right?

659
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,440
In other words, I've
got reactants,

660
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:25,560
and I've got products.

661
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:27,510
What's delta H of reaction?

662
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,040
It's delta H of formation of the
products minus delta H of

663
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,770
formation of the reactants.

664
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:42,490
That's the important message,
delta H of formation of the

665
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:54,340
products, minus delta H of
formation of the reactants.

666
00:51:54,340 --> 00:52:00,070
Any questions?

667
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:03,600
All right, tomorrow I'll go
through the remaining details.

668
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,110
The truth is after this, it's
all arithmetic, right?

669
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:09,750
We're just going to
go through it and

670
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:11,660
execute it a little bit.

671
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,200
And then we'll move on and talk
about how we'd actually

672
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,840
make some of these measurements
of delta H and

673
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:19,130
compare them to what
