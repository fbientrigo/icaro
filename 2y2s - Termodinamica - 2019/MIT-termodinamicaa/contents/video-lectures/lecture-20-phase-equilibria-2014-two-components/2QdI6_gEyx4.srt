8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,610
PROFESSOR: Alright, so last time
we started talking about

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:30,000
more complicated mixtures.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,500
To get into colligative
properties.

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:41,540
And the example we gave was a
binary system that has two

12
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,880
components.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,200
And two phases.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,010
So we have a liquid phase
on the bottom.

15
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,470
A gas phase on top, and two
components, A and B, where

16
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:05,520
compositions xA and xB are
in the liquid phase.

17
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,810
Those are the mole fractions.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,955
And yA and yB in the gas phase,
the mole fractions in

19
00:01:14,955 --> 00:01:17,290
the gas phase.

20
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,860
And what we did last time was
to begin to say how many

21
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,410
degrees of freedom do we have,
how many variables do we need

22
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,220
to completely describe
this mixture.

23
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,940
And it turned out that for this
mixture, we only needed

24
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,830
two variables.

25
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,910
Two degrees of freedom.

26
00:01:34,910 --> 00:01:36,970
We started out with four
variables; the temperature,

27
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:48,090
the pressure, and the components
in the composition

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,010
in the liquid phase and the
composition in the gas phase.

29
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,670
We need one of these, either
xA or xB, and one of these,

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,900
either yA or yB because
they add up to 1.

31
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,440
So you start with four, but
because you are in a mixture,

32
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,180
an equilibrium, you
have constraints.

33
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,950
You have the chemical potentials
that have to be

34
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,580
equal to each other.

35
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,170
The chemical potential of A in
the gas phase has to be equal

36
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,870
to the chemical potential of
A in the liquid phase.

37
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,590
And the chemical potential of
B in the gas phase has to B

38
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,512
equal to the chemical
potential of B

39
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:22,160
in the liquid phase.

40
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,540
So you start with
four variables.

41
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:32,090
Temperature, pressure, xA, yA,
then you have the constraints

42
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,890
that mu A, in the liquid phase
has to be equal to mu

43
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,860
A in the gas phase.

44
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,430
Because you're at equilibrium.

45
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,082
And mu B in the liquid phase
has to be equal to mu

46
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,790
B in the gas phase.

47
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,580
So four minus two constraints
means you have

48
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,270
two degrees of freedom.

49
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,440
And so if you want to know
everything about this mixture,

50
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,490
all you need is the temperature

51
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,570
and the total pressure.

52
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:02,960
And that's enough.

53
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,017
It's kind of amazing.

54
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:09,430
Give me the temperature and
pressure and these two

55
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,390
components, like water and
alcohol, for instance, and I

56
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,230
can tell you everything about
the compositions.

57
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,410
It's very powerful.

58
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,950
And then we said that this
turned out to be a special

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:26,290
case, or sub-case of the more
general Gibbs phase rule.

60
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:37,380
where the Gibbs phase rule tells
you that if you have C

61
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:40,670
components, in this case here
we have two, and the general

62
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:45,900
case of C components with p
phases, the number of degrees

63
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,730
of freedom is C minus
p plus two.

64
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:54,050
This is components.

65
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,100
And phases.

66
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,250
And where we're going to start
today is by proving this.

67
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:04,450
And then we'll do more with
this problem here.

68
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:08,720
So the first thing is for us
to prove Gibbs' phase rule.

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,190
So Gibbs phase rule.

70
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,810
We start out with all the
variables that we have.

71
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,750
And then we add the
constraints.

72
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,480
And for the Gibbs phase rule,
then we start with the two

73
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,950
knobs that we can
turn externally.

74
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,720
Which are the temperature
and the pressure.

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,090
So we start with temperature and
pressure, as two variables

76
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,550
that we have.

77
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,770
And then we have a
bunch of phases.

78
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,940
We have C phases.

79
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,210
And in each phase we have to
describe the composition in

80
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,270
that phase.

81
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,850
So, for each phase
alpha, we have to

82
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,670
describe its mole fraction.

83
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:48,760
So here we needed to describe
xA for phase A. And yA for

84
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,790
phase A. For component
A in the gas phase.

85
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,350
So now we have alpha
components.

86
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,860
And for each component we have
to describe its mole fraction

87
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,400
in that particular phase.

88
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,870
So we have to describe
x sub i.

89
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,040
But we have a constraint
on that.

90
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,240
The constraint is that the sum
of all the mole factions has

91
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,140
to be equal to one.

92
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,780
That's what it is, to
be a mole fraction.

93
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:25,745
So the constraint is that x sub
i, i from one to alpha, is

94
00:05:25,745 --> 00:05:30,510
equal to one.

95
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,530
So the constraint on the number
of the components,

96
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:42,470
instead of having, actually, i
goes from one to C, because

97
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:46,350
that's the number components.

98
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,210
So instead of having C different
compositions that we

99
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:54,100
need to take care of, we
only need C minus one.

100
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,530
Just like here we only
needed one, just xA.

101
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:59,190
We didn't need both xA and xB,
because we knew the sum was

102
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,310
equal to one.

103
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:05,320
So that means that we really
need C minus one variables to

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,510
describe the composition
in one of the phases.

105
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:16,320
But we have p phases,
so let me fix this.

106
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,610
We had C components.

107
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:21,000
We have p phases.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,170
And so for each phase, we have
to describe the composition.

109
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:27,850
So that means that we need p
times C minus one variables to

110
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:31,450
describe all the components
and all the phases,

111
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:33,820
plus these extra two.

112
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:38,390
So the total number variables
then that we start out with

113
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,990
before putting the fact that
we're in equilibrium, is going

114
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:47,250
to be two plus p times
C minus one.

115
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,790
So that's a basic description
of the system.

116
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,220
Then we put in the
same constraints

117
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,330
that we had up here.

118
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:58,150
In terms of the chemical
potentials.

119
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,570
If I take any of the components,
let's take the

120
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:03,240
alpha component, or the
i'th component.

121
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,970
Because it's in equilibrium, the
chemical potential of that

122
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,350
particular component has to be
the same in all the phases.

123
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:14,660
So let's take the
i'th component.

124
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:21,510
So yi in phase one has to be
equal to yi in phase two, has

125
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:25,720
to be equal to yi in phase
three, has to be equal to yi

126
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:33,350
in phase p.

127
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:35,660
All the chemical potentials have
to be the same across all

128
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,370
the phases for that component.

129
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:42,220
And if you count the number of
equations, the number of

130
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:47,240
equals signs here, that's p
minus one. p minus one equals

131
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,330
signs, constraints due to
the fact that I have an

132
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,220
equilibrium here.

133
00:07:51,220 --> 00:08:03,630
So this gives me p minus
one constraints.

134
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,640
And this is true for every
single component.

135
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,950
Every single component has to
have its chemical potential,

136
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,240
its chemical potential equal
throughout the phases.

137
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,480
So p minus one's constraint
for one component times C

138
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,000
components.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:26,100
So for a total of C times p
minus one total constraints.

140
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:29,200
My variables, my constraints.

141
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:36,680
So the number of degrees of
freedom then becomes p times C

142
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:49,180
minus one minus C times p minus
one and then plus two.

143
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,520
And if you multiply this out,
p times C gets rid of the p

144
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,780
times C here.

145
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:58,670
And you get the plus
C minus p plus two.

146
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:02,320
Which is the Gibbs phase
rule, right?

147
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,630
Which I'm going to bring
back up here.

148
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,020
C minus p plus two.

149
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:12,750
So just purely in accounting,
just accounting for the

150
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,510
variables and the constraints.

151
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:23,430
OK, any questions on
how we did this?

152
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,090
Great.

153
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:26,710
OK.

154
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:33,240
So let's move on, then, to
these ideal solutions.

155
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,110
Which is this case right here.

156
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,070
And the first thing we're going
to do is look at the

157
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:47,470
case where we have A is a
solvent, and it's volatile.

158
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,450
And B is a solute, which
is non-volatile.

159
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,520
So let's take the first case.

160
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,240
We have A volatile,
that's a solvent.

161
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,700
Could be water.

162
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,440
And B is going to
be the solute.

163
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,880
It's non-volatile.

164
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,750
And let's interchange solute
or non-volatile to be

165
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,600
consistent here.

166
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,700
So this could be sugar.

167
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:27,250
A sweet water.

168
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:41,050
So, Mr. Raoult looked at such
solutions, and found that they

169
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,470
could be well described by the
following diagram here.

170
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,300
So if I plot on the x-axis here,
from zero to one, I'm

171
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,750
going to plot the partial molar
fraction of the solute.

172
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:00,010
Partial molar fractions of the
solute, that's going to be xB.

173
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:06,740
So when xB equals to zero, I
have a pure water solution.

174
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,370
When xB is equal to one,
I have pure sugar.

175
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,990
Then on the y axis, I'm going
to plot the total pressure.

176
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:20,410
So when I have a pure water
solution, the total pressure

177
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:26,660
is going to be the same as the
vapor pressure of water at a

178
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,150
particular temperature.

179
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:36,570
Let's take temperature
fixed at some value.

180
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,840
Temperature is fixed
at some value.

181
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,320
I'm going to have the total
pressure is going to be the

182
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,970
partial pressure of the water.

183
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,290
And clearly, when I don't have
any water left, all I have is

184
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,390
the sugar, there's
no pressure.

185
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:54,440
We're going to assume that it's
totally non-volatile.

186
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,000
Obviously there's going to
be a little bit of vapor

187
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,190
pressure, even at room
temperature.

188
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:01,980
Ten to the minus, I don't know,
13 torr or something.

189
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,340
But anyway, it's basically
zero here.

190
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,680
And what Raoult said is that
while these two points are

191
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,430
just connected by
a straight line.

192
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:19,800
Simplest way to connect
two points.

193
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:27,370
Basically, he said that the
pressure of, the vapor

194
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,450
pressure of the water in
this case, is equal

195
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:38,310
to xA times pA star.

196
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:42,680
I could also plot this with xA,
going from one to zero,

197
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:49,430
since xA plus xB is
equal to one.

198
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:56,160
Or I could write this as one
minus xB times pA star.

199
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,890
Where a star, the star,
means pure water.

200
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:06,660
So pure A. And pA is the vapor
pressure of the mixture.

201
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,000
Which in this case here is the
total pressure, because I

202
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,630
don't have anything else
that's volatile.

203
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:29,240
And this is Raoult's law.

204
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,930
And the first thing that you can
use this for is to look at

205
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:35,780
your first colligative property
which is vapor

206
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:45,900
pressure lowering.

207
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,120
And let me point out another
thing first.

208
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,940
So if a solution obeys that
property here, it's called an

209
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,230
ideal solution.

210
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,470
So if the water-sugar solution
really did behave like a

211
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,290
straight line like this, as
you increase the amount of

212
00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:00,190
sugar, then it would be
an ideal solution.

213
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:02,270
Many things are very
close to it.

214
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:07,230
It's not such a bad
approximation.

215
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,490
Especially in that
region up here.

216
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,015
Around zero, when the amount
of sugar is pretty small.

217
00:14:12,015 --> 00:14:19,070
You expect to obey an ideal
solution behavior.

218
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:24,320
Alright, so let's look now at
a glass of water that has

219
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,150
sugar in it.

220
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,320
We've got my glass
of water, H20.

221
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,640
With some sugar dissolved
in it.

222
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:42,260
And it's got a certain vapor
pressure on top. pA, or pH2O.

223
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,590
And I'm going to ask the
question, what's the

224
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:48,950
difference between the vapor
pressure what it would be

225
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,370
without the sugar in it.

226
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:59,670
What is pA star minus pA?

227
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:07,230
Obeys Raoult's law. pA star,
pA is xA pA star,

228
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:09,230
plug that in here.

229
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,900
That's one minus xA pA star,
one minus xA is xB.

230
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,410
xB pA star.

231
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,010
Well, the first thing I know
is that this is a positive

232
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,573
number. xB is a positive
number. pA star

233
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:25,020
is a positive number.

234
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,500
This is greater than zero.

235
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,050
That means that the act of
putting some solute in my

236
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:37,540
water decreases the vapor
pressure of the

237
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,450
water in the gas phase.

238
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,880
Pretty simple.

239
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,130
It's called vapor
pressure law.

240
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:49,550
And we can actually take
this one step further.

241
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:57,510
We can draw a phase diagram.

242
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,990
So our usual phase diagram here
with temperature on this

243
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,470
axis here and pressure on this
axis here, and we've got our

244
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,390
triple point sitting here.

245
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:13,280
And our gas-liquid line, with
a critical point here.

246
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,770
So this is gas here, there's
a liquid here.

247
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,430
And we've got our, this
is going to be water.

248
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,690
So it's got a negative slope.

249
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:26,550
I think I've got it
right this time.

250
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,400
And there's the solid
phase here.

251
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,420
OK, this is for the
pure stuff.

252
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:40,770
So now I can draw a similar
diagram for sugared water.

253
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,500
And I just looked at
this, assuming it

254
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,480
obeys Raoult's law.

255
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:50,870
What we looked at here was the
gas-liquid coexistence.

256
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,350
And we found that the gas-liquid
coexistence point,

257
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,290
the vapor pressure of
the water, was less

258
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,740
than if it were pure.

259
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:02,670
So that means that if I looked
at the gas-liquid coexistence,

260
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:05,110
which is this line right here.

261
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:08,710
In the presence of sugar,
that whole line is

262
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:11,620
going to get lowered.

263
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,140
The pressure, the vapor
pressure, of the water is

264
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:17,400
going to be lower when
the sugar is there.

265
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:26,770
So the whole thing is
going to get lower.

266
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:32,325
Now, if I have a solid, if the
water is a solid, it's going

267
00:17:32,325 --> 00:17:34,730
to crystallize the water, the
sugar is going to be separated

268
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:36,080
from the water.

269
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,250
The sugar and the water are not
going to really know about

270
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,700
each other.

271
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:44,840
They're just going to have big
chunks of pure water, with

272
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,430
every now and then a molecule
of sugar that's in there.

273
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,680
So you don't really expect to
see any difference between the

274
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:58,980
pure solid water, in terms of
the gas-solid interface, and

275
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,290
the pure liquid water.

276
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,120
There's no sugar in
the gas phase.

277
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:11,130
And as far as the gas phase is
concerned, that solid phase is

278
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:11,820
pure water.

279
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,230
It's just seeing pure ice
crystals on the surface.

280
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
Every now and then there's
a molecule of sugar.

281
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,970
So you expect this to be
pretty close here.

282
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,850
So you expect the triple
point to go down.

283
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,246
And if I now, I go up to the
solid-liquid coexistence, and

284
00:18:30,246 --> 00:18:34,470
go up like this, I can make a
prediction about solid-liquid

285
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,950
coexistence.

286
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,380
I can predict that if I'm
looking at, let's put one bar

287
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:49,530
here somewhere.

288
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,050
One bar.

289
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,570
Room temperature, sitting
here somewhere.

290
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:57,360
One bar, room temperature,
water is all liquid.

291
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,720
This is what it would usually,
solid, liquid, that would be

292
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,510
273 degrees Kelvin.

293
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,570
That's the melting
point of water.

294
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,090
So now if I put sugar in the
water, and I follow my diagram

295
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:21,140
here, what I find is that the
new melting point of water is

296
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:29,850
some new temperature T, T1,
where T1 is less than 273

297
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:30,094
degrees Kelvin.

298
00:19:30,094 --> 00:19:31,090
You all know this.

299
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,640
When you put something, like an
impurity, a salt or sugar

300
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,830
in the water, the melting
point gets depressed.

301
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:43,110
It goes down.

302
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,030
Straight from here.

303
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,820
You can build it up straight
from here.

304
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:51,850
When we get to the colligative
properties, we'll attack it

305
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,740
from the point of chemical
potentials.

306
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,620
We'll equate chemical potentials
and we'll look at

307
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,990
the change in the chemical
potential in the water, and

308
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,090
the presence of the sugar and
we'll do it rigorously.

309
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,010
But this is sort of the first
indication that these

310
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:08,460
colligative properties are all
connected to each other.

311
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,270
They're connected to
this diagram here.

312
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,360
OK.

313
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,940
So when I was a kid, and I knew
that this was the case.

314
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,380
Everybody knows this
is the case, right?

315
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,536
You put salt in the water
and you expect all sorts

316
00:20:24,536 --> 00:20:25,180
of things to happen.

317
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,720
You expect the vapor pressure
to go down.

318
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,273
And certainly you know that you
add salt to the roads and

319
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,620
the water melts, et cetera.

320
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,850
And my mother always told me
that the reason why you added

321
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:42,360
salt to the water was so that
the temperature of the water

322
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,050
would get higher when you
try to boil pasta.

323
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:50,770
And for, I don't know, fifteen
years I believed her.

324
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,110
Until I taught thermodynamics.

325
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:58,010
And I actually calculated the
change in the temperature by

326
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,020
adding a few pinches of
salt to the water.

327
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,730
And you know how small that
temperature change is?

328
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,960
You should calculate it.

329
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,880
It's really tiny.

330
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,920
It won't make any difference
for the water.

331
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,370
Probably the difference in the
temperature of the water will

332
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,040
be the same as if I cooked here
versus halfway up Mount

333
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,460
Washington in New Hampshire
or something.

334
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,220
Probably even less.

335
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:20,875
There's no difference.

336
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,820
The reason why you add salt is
so that it tastes better.

337
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,530
That's the only reason.

338
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:28,610
It has nothing to do with
thermodynamics.

339
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:35,730
Alright, any questions
on this?

340
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,240
So we going to make it a little
bit more complicated

341
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,090
now, if there's no questions.

342
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:43,070
We're going to now have,
instead of having one

343
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,080
non-volatile solute, use we're
going to have two, we're going

344
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:47,730
to have this mixture.

345
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:58,580
Where both components
are volatile.

346
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,230
Can we erase this?

347
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:03,950
Actually, I may not
erase this.

348
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:12,140
Because I want to keep
Raoult's law here.

349
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,000
OK, we're going to have a
mixture of two volatile

350
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,550
components.

351
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,960
For instance, water
and alcohol.

352
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,510
Your your typical martini
type situation.

353
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,660
Or margarita.

354
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:40,370
Whatever's your favorite
drink.

355
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,840
So now we have xA, we have xB,
we have yA, we have yB.

356
00:22:47,840 --> 00:23:00,430
And we're going to assume that
both obey Raoult's law with

357
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,590
respect to each other.

358
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,100
So now if I draw a diagram,
and I just focus on, so

359
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,080
there's the total pressure
sitting here.

360
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,500
And I just focus on
one component

361
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,400
and ignore the other.

362
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,800
Suppose I focus on A. And I know
that A in the presence of

363
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,590
B, the partial pressure of A is
going to obey Raoult's law.

364
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,563
And let's take A to be the more
volatile component in

365
00:23:28,563 --> 00:23:30,240
this case here.

366
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,770
So pA star is bigger
than pB star.

367
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:39,820
The partial pressure, pure A,
had a particular temperature,

368
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:46,090
T fixed is bigger than pB star,
it's the more volatile

369
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,490
of the two.

370
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:56,980
So if I were to plot pA as a
function of xB, going from

371
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:59,820
zero to one, so it'll be
Raoult's law, I'm going to

372
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:04,360
start at pA star.

373
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,680
And I'm going to go down
linearly to xB equals one.

374
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,445
Now I can do the same thing for
the partial pressure of B.

375
00:24:12,445 --> 00:24:19,100
And assume that in the presence
of A, just looking at

376
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,200
this component B, now, and I'm
looking at the partial

377
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,530
pressure of B, and it's got its
impurity in it, A. B obeys

378
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,450
Raoult's law with A in there.

379
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:34,080
But now if I want to keep the
same x axis here, I can look

380
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,920
at xA here, going from
zero to one.

381
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:40,310
So I just basically flip
the thing over.

382
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:44,950
So at xA equals zero that's
pure B. pB star is

383
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,960
less than pA star.

384
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,780
I'm starting here, on that side
here. pB star, and I'm

385
00:24:49,780 --> 00:25:00,246
going down in a straight line to
zero. pB is equal to xB pB

386
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,110
star, straight line all
the way to zero when

387
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:05,210
xB is equal to zero.

388
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:08,180
So that's pB.

389
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,860
And that's pA.

390
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:17,250
Now, the total pressure is the
sum of the two. pA plus pB.

391
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,570
So the total pressure in this
system here, that I measure

392
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,740
here, is just the sum of these
two straight lines.

393
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,220
Let me do it in blue.

394
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,510
The total pressure, if you add
up these two straight lines

395
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,320
together, you got another
straight line.

396
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,460
Two straight lines make a
straight line. p is pA plus pB

397
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:48,030
is equal to xA pA star
plus xB pB star.

398
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:54,200
Now, xA and xB are related.
xB is one minus xA.

399
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,080
And so really, this is only a
function of one variable here.

400
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:02,820
Linearly, with respect
to one variable.

401
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,190
OK, what does this
diagram tell me?

402
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:13,020
So now, let's ignore
how we built it.

403
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,490
And let's take a look at it.

404
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:23,760
So I have, going to take
xB on the bottom here.

405
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,140
From zero to one.

406
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,120
We could choose either one, and
I've got the straight line

407
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:36,370
for the total pressure going
from pA star to pB star.

408
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:38,890
T is fixed.

409
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,360
I need to tell you that T is
fixed because I have two

410
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,920
degrees of freedom, right?

411
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,700
I have two degrees of freedom.

412
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,500
My degrees of freedom are the
temperature, which I'm fixing.

413
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,880
And the composition
in the liquid

414
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,500
phase, which I'm fixing.

415
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:59,850
So my two variables are
xB and T. Those are my

416
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,820
two degrees of freedom.

417
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,330
And I'm telling you what
the total pressure is.

418
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:08,190
I'm giving you total pressure as
a function of xB and T. By

419
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,510
fixing T, I'm really telling
you what the pressure is of

420
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,190
the function of xB.

421
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,250
So the Gibbs phase rule then
tells me that the pressure

422
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,300
should be only a function
of xB if T is fixed.

423
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,600
Should be a line.

424
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,980
Not necessarily straight,
but it should be a

425
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,030
line in this diagram.

426
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:28,070
To have coexistence.

427
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:32,330
So what this line is, then,
this line is the line of

428
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,230
points that tells me when I have
coexistence between the

429
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,350
gas phase and the
liquid phase.

430
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,516
The coexistence line.

431
00:27:41,516 --> 00:27:44,960
This is the gas-liquids
coexistence

432
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,370
line for the mixture.

433
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:55,440
It's not so different than this
coexistence line up here.

434
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,250
So you can think of this as a
phase diagram, kind of like

435
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:02,810
you thought, you know this
as a phase diagram.

436
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:05,360
It's got a coexistence line.

437
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,400
And then if I'm above this
line, if I'm at a certain

438
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:13,810
pressure here, I'm at this
point here, this pressure

439
00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:17,620
well, let's go to a
slightly higher

440
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,730
different pressure here.

441
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,890
And this composition here.

442
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:24,540
I'm not on the line.

443
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,230
That means that I don't
have coexistence

444
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,380
between liquid and gas.

445
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,260
I'm above the line.

446
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,215
I'm at a pressure higher then
where I would get coexistence.

447
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:38,060
The pressure is higher,
means I probably don't

448
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:42,170
have a gas any more.

449
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:45,320
Probably means that the total
pressure pushing down on my

450
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,730
mixture is too high to have
a gas phase around.

451
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:55,700
It means that the top part
here is a liquid phase.

452
00:28:55,700 --> 00:29:00,760
So I'm in the liquid phase if
I'm above this line and I have

453
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,590
a coexistence between the
gas and the liquid

454
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,310
if I'm on the line.

455
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:13,210
Now, if I'm below this line
here, well, I get in trouble.

456
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:17,740
I get in trouble because my
first instinct would be, well

457
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,120
this is just gas.

458
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,400
I go from liquid, and then
I have coexistence.

459
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,180
Then I go into the gas phase.

460
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,090
But my x-axis here is
the composition

461
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,670
in the liquid phase.

462
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,990
There's no liquid around.

463
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,130
So I really can't say
anything here.

464
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:37,300
This diagram is a little bit
meaningless down here.

465
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,500
Because my x-axis is describing
a phase which

466
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:45,150
doesn't exist on the diagram.

467
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:48,650
On this diagram, here.

468
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:51,430
So when you see it, this diagram
here with Raoult's law

469
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:54,810
on it, you've got to remember
that the part that's really

470
00:29:54,810 --> 00:30:00,090
interesting is above the line
and at the line itself.

471
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:14,100
So you could do an experiment,
then, on this line here.

472
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,330
T fixed.

473
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:20,170
This is the liquid phase.

474
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,420
So suppose I start
with some high

475
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,620
pressure up here somewhere.

476
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:29,220
At this point, let's call
this point one.

477
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:36,680
We've got my container, my
piston here. p is equal to p1.

478
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,676
Again, I put the point
in an awkward place.

479
00:30:38,676 --> 00:30:51,400
Let's put it right there.
p1, and composition xB.

480
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:56,800
p1 and xB here.

481
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:02,510
And I'm going to slowly
decrease the pressure.

482
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,770
I start in this composition.

483
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,720
The composition doesn't
change.

484
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,070
I'm just decreasing
the pressure.

485
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,450
Decrease the pressure, decrease
the pressure,

486
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,060
decrease the pressure.

487
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,530
And at some point, I
get to that line.

488
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,540
Get to that line, what happens
when I get to that line?

489
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,260
I start to see bubbles coming
out of the liquid.

490
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:22,530
Vapor starts to form, because
it wants to be in the

491
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,330
coexistence line.

492
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:25,490
So I get to that line.

493
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,100
And I get a little bit
of bubbles forming.

494
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,060
And a little bit of vapor.

495
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,980
That's the liquid here.

496
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,090
Little bit of gas.

497
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:44,870
And that's why this line here
is called the bubble line.

498
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:48,250
So I've gone down, decreased
the pressure.

499
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,740
So p has gone down now.

500
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:52,600
Decreased the pressure.

501
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,740
And if I keep on decreasing
pressure, well, I'm not going

502
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,450
to jump into this area
of the diagram.

503
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:02,690
Because this area of the diagram
means there's no

504
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:05,410
liquid, it's a meaningless
area.

505
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:08,416
If I keep decreasing the
pressure, I'm still going to

506
00:32:08,416 --> 00:32:09,190
be in coexistence.

507
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:12,170
I'm just going to
make more gas.

508
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,170
More vapor.

509
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,610
I'm going to transfer
more of the liquid

510
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:17,070
into the vapor phase.

511
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:21,120
I'm going to ride
down that line.

512
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,370
I'm going to ride
down the line.

513
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,320
I'm decreasing the pressure.

514
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,510
I'm not going to
skip into here.

515
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,150
I'm going to ride down
the line here.

516
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,690
We're going to keep decreasing
the pressure even more. p goes

517
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:34,060
down even more.

518
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,820
Now, I make even more vapor.

519
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,620
There's my piston right there.

520
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,850
There's the gas phase.

521
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:46,240
There's the liquid phase.

522
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,400
Now I've transferred material
from the liquid

523
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,730
phase to the gas phase.

524
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,810
But I also changed
the composition

525
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:57,500
of my liquid phase.

526
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,420
And if I read my new
composition, this is what I

527
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,080
started out with. xB.

528
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:09,990
My new composition in the liquid
phase is going to be,

529
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:15,220
let's call it xB prime.

530
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,340
There's going to be more
solute in there.

531
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:24,310
Or more B in there, than what
I started out with.

532
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,800
Now which one was the
more volatile one?

533
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,950
A or B?

534
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,320
A was more volatile, right?

535
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,610
So as I decreased the pressure
and I started bubbling off the

536
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:38,410
material, which one's going to
bubble off preferentially?

537
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:39,910
A is going to.

538
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:47,350
So it makes sense that I would
concentrate B in there.

539
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:49,040
Decrease the pressure.

540
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,820
Bubbles that are rich
in A come out.

541
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,940
Both A and B come out.

542
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:56,940
But more A comes out than B. And
what's left over is rich

543
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,080
and then more than the less
volatile material which is B.

544
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,920
So we're beginning to see how
distillation comes about.

545
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,730
This is the first step in it.

546
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:18,220
In a distillation process.

547
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,410
So let's make this a little
bit more complicated now.

548
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:30,380
Any questions, first?

549
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,490
Alright, now, suppose
I wanted to know.

550
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:36,280
So I found out where the
composition in the liquid

551
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,080
phase is here.

552
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,505
And I know that should tell
me immediately whether the

553
00:34:41,505 --> 00:34:43,970
composition in the gas
phase is here.

554
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,860
So I have all, I have everything
I need to know to

555
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:52,030
calculate what the composition
in the gas phase is.

556
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:55,220
So I have everything I need,
then, to calculate and draw a

557
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,510
diagram that looks
just like this.

558
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:04,520
Except where my x-axis is the
y's instead of the x's.

559
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,660
Going to make the same diagram,
except now I'm going

560
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:10,380
to use the gas phase as
my reference point.

561
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,590
The composition in
the gas phase.

562
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:22,190
So I need to get, so here I
got p as a function of xB.

563
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:30,250
I want p, total pressure,
as a function of yB.

564
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:33,240
So I can draw a diagram that
looks just like this except

565
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:41,310
now with the x-axis being the
gas phase composition.

566
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:41,980
Let's turn the crank.

567
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,880
What do I know?

568
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:55,400
I know Dalton's law. pA is
yA times total pressure.

569
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:59,810
I'm trying mix up the partial
pressures and the total

570
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,950
pressure in all ways that
I know how to write it.

571
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,595
And then hope that something's
going to come out that's going

572
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:06,540
to be helpful.

573
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,700
So that's Dalton's law.

574
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:17,960
I know Raoult's law. pA is
xA star times pA star.

575
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,740
And that's Raoult.

576
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,400
And I can write Raoult's
law in a different way.

577
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,120
I can write as pB is equal to
xB pB star, that's just

578
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:41,310
Raoult's law for B. One
minus xA pB star.

579
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:45,200
And I'm looking for this.

580
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,340
I'm looking for the composition
in the gas phase.

581
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:50,687
Or the total pressure as a
function of the composition in

582
00:36:50,687 --> 00:36:51,010
the gas phase.

583
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:54,830
Let's start by finding the
composition in the gas phase

584
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,610
as a function of
the composition

585
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:58,450
in the liquid phase.

586
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:01,990
And the total pressure.

587
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:08,940
Rewrite yA is equal to
pA over P. Total

588
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,380
pressure is pA plus pB.

589
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,320
Sum of the two partial
pressures. pA over pA plus pB.

590
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,290
And I'm trying to get yA
in terms of the xA's.

591
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,000
Or xB's, in terms
of composition

592
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,680
in the liquid phase.

593
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,860
And I know how to relate
that to a constant.

594
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:29,850
Which is the vapor pressure of
the pure material times the,

595
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,280
and the composition of the
liquid phase, Raoult's law.

596
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:44,490
This is xA pA star divided by
xA pA star plus xB pB star.

597
00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:46,750
And I know that xB
is one minus xA.

598
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:59,320
So this is xA pA star times pB
star plus pA star minus pB

599
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,900
star times xA.

600
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,330
Where all I did was replace
xB with one minus xA.

601
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:10,070
And rearrange my equation
on the bottom.

602
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:15,310
So I've gotten the composition
in the gas phase in terms of

603
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:17,960
the composition in
the liquid phase.

604
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,830
They're not independent.

605
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,430
I knew they weren't
independent.

606
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,220
And this just shows me
that math works.

607
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,490
OK.

608
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,500
So I've got that.

609
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,620
And I can invert this to get the
composition in the liquid

610
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,080
phase in terms of the
composition in the gas phase.

611
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,200
It's not so straightforward,
but you can get xA as a

612
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,720
function of yA, as well.

613
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,300
You've got xA, if you reverse
this you get xA is

614
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,605
equal to yA pB star.

615
00:38:44,605 --> 00:38:54,420
It looks kind of the same. pB
star plus pA star plus pB star

616
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:01,310
minus pA star times yA. xA
as a function of yA.

617
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:05,880
Alright.

618
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,690
So now you can actually put
everything together, starting

619
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:13,200
from Dalton's law.

620
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,920
Because really what we want
is the total pressure as a

621
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,070
function of the composition
in the gas phase.

622
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:20,500
So there's our total
pressure here.

623
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,740
There's the composition
in the gas phase.

624
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,520
There's pA.

625
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,960
We've found composition in
the gas phase in terms of

626
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,930
composition in the
liquid phase.

627
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:38,620
P is equal to yA over pA.

628
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:45,050
Which is equal to yA
over xA pA star.

629
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:48,030
So if we could get rid of
this here, in terms of

630
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,200
yA, we'd be all set.

631
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,800
We'd get the total pressure as
a function of the composition

632
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,240
in the gas phase.

633
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,860
And there's what we need.

634
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:00,420
So we plug that in here.

635
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:06,320
And now we have the total
pressure in terms of constants

636
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:12,310
like these pure vapor pressures
and the composition

637
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:18,380
of A in the gas phase.

638
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:21,110
So let me find a way to
write that somewhere.

639
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:24,870
Let me write it right here
in this little box here.

640
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:29,150
Plug it in, you get something
that's not a straight line.

641
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,010
Unfortunately.

642
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:37,330
Doesn't look like Raoult's law.
pA star pB star. pA star

643
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:48,790
plus pB star minus
pA star times yA.

644
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:49,950
It's not a straight line.

645
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:57,390
It's a more complicated
function.

646
00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:16,860
What does it look like?

647
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,430
Looks like this.

648
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:23,050
I'm going to use the
same sort of plot.

649
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,040
I going to plot the total
pressure on this axis here, on

650
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:25,920
the y axis.

651
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,120
I'm going to keep the T fixed.

652
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,210
Temperature is fixed.

653
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,220
So I'm going to find the total
pressure as a function of the

654
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,270
composition in the gas phase.

655
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:42,870
I'm going to put yB here. yB
going from zero to one.

656
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:50,720
So it's kind of looking like
what I had before.

657
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,990
Total pressure is going
to look the same.

658
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:54,450
If you want to do it in terms of
B, you just have everywhere

659
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:56,240
you see B replace it with A.
And everywhere you see A

660
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,130
replace it with B. You just
need to change the two.

661
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:06,730
You know that if yB is equal to
zero, that you have pure A.

662
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:12,190
So you know that this is going
to be pA star here.

663
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:14,630
You know if you have yB equals
to one in the gas phase, you

664
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,080
have pure B in the gas phase.

665
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:20,320
You know that what you have is
the vapor pressure of the pure

666
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:26,540
B, in this case the pure
water. pB star, OK?

667
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:32,300
Where A is more volatile then B.
A would be the ethanol and

668
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,830
B would be the water.

669
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,330
And it's not a straight line.

670
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,414
If it were Raoult, he would
say just connect these two

671
00:42:39,414 --> 00:42:40,280
with a straight line.

672
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,310
But it's not.

673
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:44,280
It's not, we just figured out
with an equation here.

674
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,050
And it turns out to be a line
that looks like this.

675
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:55,150
It's a curved line that
looks a bit like this.

676
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,020
OK, what does this line mean?

677
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,540
This line is also a
coexistence line.

678
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,510
That's what we started
out with.

679
00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:05,410
We started out with Raoult.

680
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:07,560
That was part of
our derivation.

681
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,120
Raoult's law tells you the
composition at coexistence.

682
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,260
Tells you the pressure of, the
total pressure, or partial

683
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,200
pressure at coexistence
and the composition.

684
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,820
So this is a coexistence
line between the

685
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:26,390
liquid and the gas.

686
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:28,120
Coexistence between
liquid and gas.

687
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,382
But now, it's not as a function
of the composition at

688
00:43:30,382 --> 00:43:30,990
the liquid phase.

689
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,500
It's a function of the
composition in the gas phase.

690
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,460
Which was missing before.

691
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,890
So now if I do my experiment,
and I'm, so

692
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:44,950
what does this mean?

693
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:48,540
So if I have a point, if I have
a pressure which is lower

694
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,110
than the line here, then
I have pure gas.

695
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,820
Pressure, low pressure,
I have pure gas.

696
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,810
Don't have any liquids.

697
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,950
And that's fine, because
I can, I know

698
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:57,600
what that point is.

699
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:02,870
If I'm sitting below the
line here somewhere,

700
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,640
so I'm sitting here.

701
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,630
Some composition in the gas
phase, a certain pressure.

702
00:44:09,630 --> 00:44:11,300
That's fine.

703
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,280
It's a meaningful point.

704
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,870
So my container here
has a piston on it.

705
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:26,120
And I'm starting out with
this pressure, p1 here.

706
00:44:26,120 --> 00:44:27,490
p1 pressing down.

707
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:30,240
And I got yB in this here.

708
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,930
And I increase the pressure,
pressure goes up.

709
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,340
Composition doesn't change.

710
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,250
I'm just increasing
the pressure.

711
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,640
Increasing the pressure,
increasing the pressure.

712
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,380
Now, at some point the pressure
becomes big enough

713
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:44,720
that I start to see
liquid forming.

714
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:54,970
Little drops of liquid forming
in my container.

715
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:58,255
So now I have little drops of
liquid that are forming in my

716
00:44:58,255 --> 00:45:01,750
container, that are going to
start to rain down and form a

717
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:04,290
little bit of liquid
pooling at the

718
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:05,640
bottom of the container.

719
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:10,420
And that's called
the dew line.

720
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,860
The other one was called the
bubble line, this is called

721
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,520
the dew line.

722
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:19,180
So when I reach the dew line,
I start forming liquid.

723
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,210
And again, just like in the
previous case, if I keep

724
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:24,360
increasing the pressure, I don't
go into this area here.

725
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,770
First of all, this area's
meaningless for

726
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,620
this diagram here.

727
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:31,550
Because this area's
pure liquid.

728
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:34,070
But the x-axis here doesn't tell
me about the composition

729
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:34,530
of pure liquid.

730
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,680
It's all yB.

731
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,130
It's all about the composition
in the gas -- yes.

732
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,980
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

733
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,130
PROFESSOR: Between the dew
line and the bubble line?

734
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:43,410
STUDENT: Yeah.

735
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:44,330
PROFESSOR: This never,
never world.

736
00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,970
Where you're not allowed
to inhabit.

737
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:54,760
We're going to go into
that next time.

738
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,920
On how to use those two
curves together.

739
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,220
OK, but the same thing
happens here.

740
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,270
If I increase the pressure,
I'm going to ride the

741
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:01,680
coexistence line up.

742
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:12,770
I ride it up, and keep
riding it up.

743
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,780
And I get liquid forming
in here.

744
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,325
And I can find out the
composition in

745
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:17,100
the gas phase now.

746
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:20,490
The composition in the gas
phase, as I increase the

747
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:25,620
pressure, I get yB prime,
there's yB that I

748
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:26,920
started out with with.

749
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:30,510
With yB prime is less than yB.

750
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:37,320
And remember, B was the less
volatile of the two.

751
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:42,200
As I increase the pressure,
I am forming liquid.

752
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:46,030
The composition in the
gas phase changes.

753
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:50,750
You decrease the mole fraction
of the less volatile material

754
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:51,440
in the gas phase.

755
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,300
The more volatile
A becomes more

756
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:57,010
prevalent in the gas phase.

757
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:01,250
And what's coming down is
mostly, then, it's enriched in

758
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:07,190
B. You've done an enrichment of
the less volatile material

759
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:10,220
down in here.

760
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:12,750
And now you can put the
two together, as the

761
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:19,420
question was asked.

762
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,970
Now we can have, we mix
the two together.

763
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:27,610
We mix our Raoult diagram with
our dew line diagram.

764
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,050
We mix the bubble line and
the dew line together.

765
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,500
In one diagram, which
is going to be a

766
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:48,730
powerful diagram to use.

767
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:51,040
Total pressure.

768
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:54,510
Temperature fixed.

769
00:47:54,510 --> 00:48:02,600
You've got two materials, pA
star is bigger than pB star.

770
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:08,830
So I'm going to have pA star
here, pB star down here.

771
00:48:08,830 --> 00:48:13,590
And if I choose, as my x-axis,
to have xB going from zero to

772
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:18,700
one, I can draw a coexistence
line on this axis.

773
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,520
On this diagram.

774
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:24,770
That's the coexistence
line in terms of xB.

775
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:29,910
And any point up here is
well-described by this xB

776
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:32,870
value, and the p value.

777
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:36,770
And as long as I have xB here,
I'm not allowed to touch the

778
00:48:36,770 --> 00:48:38,600
bottom part of this diagram.

779
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:43,220
But now if I add another x-axis,
I'm going to add yB.

780
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:50,550
From zero to one.

781
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:53,230
I draw a coexistence line
in terms of yB.

782
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:56,500
Like this.

783
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,550
So this line is p
as a function of

784
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:01,850
yB coexistence line.

785
00:49:01,850 --> 00:49:08,030
This line is total pressure
of function of xB.

786
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:11,460
And as long as I'm on this line
or below this line, then

787
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,900
this axis makes sense.

788
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,320
That's how we build
this diagram here.

789
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,880
It's got a bubble line
on top, and the

790
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,520
dew line on the bottom.

791
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:26,060
So I'm up here going down, I'm
going to hit the bubble line.

792
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:28,590
If I'm down here and go up
in pressure, I'm going

793
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:29,460
to hit the dew line.

794
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,610
And next time -- well, next
time we have an exam.

795
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:38,020
But on Friday, we'll figure out
how to use this diagram.
