8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:27,250
PROFESSOR: I want to remind
and clarify as needed the

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:36,420
equilibrium constant Kp for
gas phase reaction was the

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,060
ratios of the partial pressures
referenced to some

11
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,110
reference pressure, which we
usually take as one, one bar.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:54,952
To the stoichiometry , pD
divided by p naught, to the mu

13
00:00:54,952 --> 00:00:57,910
D where species C and
D are products.

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:11,540
And the reactants are
on the bottom.

15
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:19,350
And usually we don't write p
naught, but it's important to

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,380
remember that it's there.

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,360
And then we can also write this
in terms of the Gibbs

18
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,170
free energy for the reaction.

19
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:32,920
The standard Gibbs free energy,
minus delta G naught

20
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,570
of the reaction,
divided by RT.

21
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,860
And what this tells us is
that this is a number.

22
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,930
This is a number, there's
no pre-factor

23
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,240
here that has units.

24
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,640
That's a unitless number.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:04,410
And it doesn't depend on
the total pressure.

26
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,905
And the other thing to remember
is that delta G

27
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:10,080
naught for the reaction is
the process of taking the

28
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,760
reactants separated in separate
boxes, separate

29
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:19,090
containers, and the final
product, the final step, is

30
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:22,350
the products separated in
individual containers.

31
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,435
That's what we write when
we write delta G

32
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:30,190
naught for the reaction.

33
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,340
We also looked at K in terms
of mole fractions.

34
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,020
So if you replace all the
partial pressures with the

35
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,360
mole fraction times the total
pressure, you get an

36
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,560
expression for K sub x, which we
define as the mole fraction

37
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:59,140
of the products to the
stoichiometric powers.

38
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,420
Which is also unitless.

39
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,880
This is true, it's unitless.

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,940
But, if you write it in terms of
K sub p, the total pressure

41
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,880
comes in here. p total, divided
by the reference

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,770
pressure to the minus delta nu,
where this is the change

43
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:21,010
in the number of moles,
in going from

44
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,330
reactants to products.

45
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,810
And there's K sub
p sitting here.

46
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:28,620
So unlike K sub p, which doesn't
depend on the total

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,040
pressure, K sub x does depend on
the total pressure through

48
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:47,340
this term right here.

49
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,970
So when we look at problems
where we change the pressure,

50
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:53,300
the total pressure of
the system, this is

51
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,400
going to stay the same.

52
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,130
Because it only cares
about delta G

53
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,880
naught for the reaction.

54
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,586
But this K sub x will depend
on the total pressure.

55
00:04:01,586 --> 00:04:10,330
And that's often a source of
confusion in doing problems.

56
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,700
OK, any questions?

57
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,060
We're going to do an example
where we change

58
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:16,600
the pressure first.

59
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,340
So there are examples in the
notes, and I'm going to skip

60
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:20,470
the first one.

61
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,930
I'm going to go to the second
one, which is the effect of

62
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,840
the total pressure
on the reaction.

63
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,840
And Le Chatelier's principle,
for pressure.

64
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,720
And the example we're going to
take is a fairly standard

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,040
example, also.

66
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:46,450
Which is the reaction of N2O4,
which is a gas, to 2 NO2,

67
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,670
which is a gas, the kind of
reaction that happens when you

68
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:59,080
have smog and, fairly common
in big cities.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,130
The question we're going to ask
is, what happens when we

70
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,690
change the total pressure
in this reaction here.

71
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,600
Which way does the
equilibrium go?

72
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,700
Does it go to the right,
does it go to the left?

73
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,650
Does it go to the products
or the reactants.

74
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,270
And so, in order to answer that
question, we're going to

75
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,970
ask a slightly different
question.

76
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,280
We're going to ask what is the
molar ratio, what is the

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:31,270
fraction, what is fraction
of the reactant,

78
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:39,920
the N2O4 that's reacted.

79
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,120
That has reacted.

80
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,800
And we're going to
call that alpha.

81
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:56,470
It's the number of moles that
have reacted divided by number

82
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:03,350
of moles initially.

83
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:08,110
So we're going to need to find
at equilibrium what is the

84
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,950
number of moles of N2O4
that has reacted.

85
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,640
So we have to set
up the problem.

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,180
And so the way that, the
standard way of setting up the

87
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:30,300
problem is to write the
equilibrium, 2 NO2 gas.

88
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,650
And then on this line here, we
write the initial conditions

89
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,490
before we set up the
equilibrium.

90
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,960
And let's say that we
have n moles of N2O4

91
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,880
initially in the box.

92
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,550
And zero moles of the NO2.

93
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,970
So we have n moles here.

94
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:47,320
And zero moles here.

95
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,170
At equilibrium, let's write
the number of moles.

96
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:52,640
A certain number of moles of
N2O4 will have reacted, let's

97
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,880
call that x.

98
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,940
So n minus x moles left.

99
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:59,970
For every x moles of N2O4 that's
reacted, we create two

100
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:01,820
moles of NO2.

101
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,270
So we have 2x here.

102
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,060
And then we're going to need
the total number of moles,

103
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,060
because we're going
to be doing mole

104
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,460
ratios, mole fractions.

105
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,020
So the total number of moles
at any time is the sum of

106
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,130
these two, n minus x plus 2x.

107
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,900
It's n plus x.

108
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,020
So if we're going to be writing
our equilibrium

109
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,780
constant in terms of mole
fractions, we're going to need

110
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,180
mole fractions.

111
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,010
So the mole fraction at any time
is n minus x divided by

112
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,290
the total number of moles,
which we just

113
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,110
calculated as n plus x.

114
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,210
And this is 2x divided by
the total number of

115
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,610
moles, n plus x.

116
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:49,640
And what we want is
this ratio here.

117
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,070
We want the ratio of the number
of moles reacted, which

118
00:07:55,070 --> 00:08:01,010
is x, that's the number
of moles that's gone.

119
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:03,560
That have reacted.

120
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,130
Divided by the number of moles
initially, which is n.

121
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,120
That's what we want.

122
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,740
We want to see how that is going
to change with pressure.

123
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:18,160
So we're going to deal first
with Kp, because Kp doesn't

124
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,990
depend on total pressure.

125
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:21,870
We're going to write
that down.

126
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:24,850
Then we're going to
go to Kx, somehow.

127
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,040
And that's going to depend
on pressure.

128
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:37,160
So let's see what Kp is here.

129
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:41,020
So K sub p, you've got
the products on top.

130
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,490
So it's the partial pressure
of NO2 to the second power,

131
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,900
divided by the partial
pressure of

132
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,130
N2O4 to the one power.

133
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,600
And everything is referenced
to one bar,

134
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,180
everything's in bar.

135
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,060
And in terms of the molar
fractions, it's the total

136
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:04,380
pressure squared, times the mole
fraction of NO2 squared,

137
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,290
divided by the total pressure
to the first power.

138
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,680
So the square root on
top gets divided by

139
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,350
one factor of pressure.

140
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,830
So we have total pressure
in front.

141
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:25,340
Divided by x to the N2O4,
and that's p times Kx.

142
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,950
So let's plug in what these mole
fractions are from our

143
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:30,950
table here.

144
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,930
The mole fraction of NO2 is
2x divided by n plus x.

145
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:39,040
2x divided by n plus x
to the square power.

146
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,650
Mole fraction of N2O4, n minus
x over n plus x. n minus x

147
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,560
over n plus x.

148
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,270
Multiply, square the
top, 4x squared.

149
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:52,220
Divided by n plus x squared.

150
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,900
Things sort of cancel out here.

151
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,770
Rearrange.

152
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:05,830
4x squared divided by n squared
minus x squared.

153
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,220
What we're really interested
in is, we're not

154
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,550
interested in x.

155
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,690
We're interested in
x divided by n.

156
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:17,610
So let's divide both the top and
the bottom by n squared.

157
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,120
And we're going to get
alpha come up.

158
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:28,200
So this is then p times 4 alpha
squared divided by one

159
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,350
minus alpha squared.

160
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,390
This is not, there's no
total pressure here.

161
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,310
The only way, the only place,
where the total pressure comes

162
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:42,500
in, is right here.

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,655
This is just a number that
doesn't care what the total

164
00:10:44,655 --> 00:10:45,250
pressure is.

165
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:47,260
Which is why we're using it.

166
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,810
And not K sub x, which cares
what the total pressure is.

167
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:54,590
So now we can solve for alpha.

168
00:10:54,590 --> 00:11:03,870
We can solve for alpha by
rearranging this equation.

169
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:07,140
This is just a number.

170
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,290
And this is where the total
pressure comes in.

171
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,020
So you rearrange that, and you
get alpha is equal to 1 plus

172
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:22,050
4p divided by Kp, to the
minus 1/2 power.

173
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,080
And if I rewrite that slightly
to make it a little bit easier

174
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,880
to see what's going to happen,
when I change the pressure, 1

175
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:37,120
plus 4p divided by Kp,
to the 1/2 power.

176
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,530
And that's what I'm after.

177
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:48,910
This tells me what happens at
equilibrium to the amount of

178
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:53,250
NO2 as I change the
total pressure.

179
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,780
This is the only place
where it comes in.

180
00:11:54,780 --> 00:12:03,020
So now I can see that if I
raise the pressure in my

181
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:09,200
container, raise the pressure,
this is in the denominator, so

182
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,030
this fraction gets smaller.

183
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,550
Alpha gets smaller.

184
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:22,250
I raise the pressure, the
fraction of material that

185
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,170
reacts gets smaller.

186
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:30,480
Therefore, the reaction goes
towards the reactants.

187
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:38,160
If I decrease the pressure, this
is a smaller number here.

188
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,500
The fraction gets bigger.

189
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,990
Alpha goes up.

190
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,210
If I decrease the pressure and
I compare what happens to the

191
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:51,320
number of moles of reactants
that react, more of it reacts.

192
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,140
Equilibrium shifts towards
the product.

193
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,680
And this is Le Chatelier
that you already know.

194
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:10,480
Le Chatelier's principle,
for pressure.

195
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,860
The way it works is that Le
Chatelier's principle states

196
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:23,050
that, this chemical system wants
to stay as close to what

197
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:23,820
it was before.

198
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,620
It doesn't like change.

199
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,030
It doesn't want to have
any change happen.

200
00:13:28,030 --> 00:13:34,280
So if you increase the pressure,
the chemical system

201
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,320
says, hey, you know I'm not so
happy that you're increasing

202
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,860
the pressure on me.

203
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,030
I'd like to go back to
a smaller pressure.

204
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,020
It doesn't like change.

205
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,780
Very conservative.

206
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,760
And the way to decrease the
pressure is to decrease the

207
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,230
number of moles in
the container.

208
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:55,140
How does it decrease the
number of moles?

209
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,590
Goes back to where there
are fewer moles.

210
00:13:56,590 --> 00:14:03,870
And that's on the
reactant side.

211
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:06,450
How many of you know
Lenz's law?

212
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:07,980
In magnetism.

213
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,070
The diamagnetic materials.

214
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,830
Right.

215
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,760
At least one person knows it.

216
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,640
It's the same idea.

217
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,880
You take a diamagnetic material
in the absence of a

218
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,820
magnetic field, and you slowly
move it into a place where

219
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,920
there's high magnetic field,
what does the diamagnetic

220
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,110
material do?

221
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,680
It orients its magnetic moment
to reverse the field.

222
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,160
So that there's no
field inside.

223
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,740
It starts out with no field.

224
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,640
Doesn't like change.

225
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,590
So Lenz's law says it's going to
do whatever it can so that

226
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,450
it retains no field inside.

227
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,790
Le Chatelier's principle is
basically the same thing.

228
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:50,100
Equilibrium systems are
very unhappy if you

229
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,330
try to change them.

230
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,950
And that's what happens for Le
Chatelier here with pressure.

231
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:01,790
Any questions?

232
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,660
So before we go to Le
Chatelier's with temperature,

233
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,570
and the van 't Hoff equation.

234
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:11,290
Let's do a little detour here
and talk about equilibrium in

235
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,960
solution, which is really as
important, or if not important

236
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,430
for a lot of you, then gas
phase equilibrium.

237
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:23,320
Although gas phase equilibrium
was where everything started.

238
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,860
And still a huge deal.

239
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:32,330
OK, so in equilibrium now, when
we talk about equilibrium

240
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:35,290
in solution, we still have
to, still going to be

241
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,870
the chemical potential.

242
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,680
It's still going to be looking
at how chemical potential

243
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,530
likes to go downhill.

244
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:46,730
And we're going to have to write
chemical potential for a

245
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,140
species, A, let's say,
which is in solution.

246
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:54,920
At some concentration
c sub A in solution.

247
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:03,860
And the concentration could be
given in moles per liter.

248
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,510
Or it could be in
grams per liter.

249
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:13,910
Or it could be in grams
per 1000 grams.

250
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,860
Whatever your favorite unit
of concentration is.

251
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,740
Use it.

252
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:20,210
Stick to it.

253
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,260
And in order to do equilibrium,
we're going to

254
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:28,360
have to reference it to, so this
would be the species at

255
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,280
some arbitrary concentration.

256
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,110
We're going to have to reference
it to some reference

257
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,730
concentration.

258
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,210
Just like we referenced
everything to one bar before,

259
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,920
as our standard pressure.

260
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,860
And we're going to take, usually
you take one mole per

261
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,690
liter, or one gram per liter,
or one whatever.

262
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:47,750
One as your reference
concentration.

263
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,220
And the reference concentration
is going to

264
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,460
disappear from the equation.

265
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,140
It's just like the reference
pressure.

266
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,100
Disappear from the equation.

267
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,320
So we're going to reference this
to some standard state

268
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,580
chemical potential.

269
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:06,390
Where the naught refers now to
the standard concentration.

270
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:12,245
And instead of having RT
log p, now we're going

271
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:16,500
to have RT log cA.

272
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,390
It's kind of like considering
the molecules in the solution

273
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:26,240
to act like an ideal gas.

274
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,730
Knowing fully well that behind,
that underneath the

275
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,280
cA, is this reference
concentration of one.

276
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,960
One whatever is your
favorite units.

277
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,230
Now, it's a little bit
more complicated than

278
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:41,420
for the ideal gas.

279
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,550
Because your solution may
contain other things than your

280
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,740
reactants and your products.

281
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,920
Especially if you're
doing biology.

282
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,430
It could be a buffer.

283
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,390
It could be a buffer,
it could have salt.

284
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:00,160
It could have a pH that's not
equal to seven, whatever.

285
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,060
And so this reference, chemical
potential, now needs

286
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:12,380
to be referenced to a particular
pH or salt

287
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,120
concentration.

288
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,280
Or whatever the properties
of your solvent are.

289
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,240
Or your solution are.

290
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,660
And that's the big difference.

291
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,980
In an ideal gas, it's

292
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,870
reference to vacuum, basically.

293
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,090
There's nothing there.

294
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,340
In here, in solution you have
all these molecules of

295
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:38,000
solvent, molecules of salt,
molecules of acid, or

296
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,260
whatever, that are going to be
around to buffer the pH.

297
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,320
And that's going to change what
the chemical potential of

298
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,370
a species is.

299
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,160
And if I change the pH and I've
got a molecule that I'm

300
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,500
interested in, it may not have
an acidic moiety on it, but it

301
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:59,660
could still care what
the pH is, slightly.

302
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,990
And that would change what the
reference potential is,

303
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:03,920
chemical potential is.

304
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,540
So this is really important
to remember.

305
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,640
And there are textbooks that are
written on how to do this

306
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,090
the right way.

307
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:10,110
We're not going to
do that here.

308
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,020
We're just going to remember
this is, we're going to assume

309
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,290
that this is done correctly.

310
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:20,360
Once you take that as a given,
that you have a way to have a

311
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,630
reference chemical potential
at a properly referenced pH

312
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,520
and salt concentration, then
you can go through the same

313
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,740
analysis that we went to
for partial pressures.

314
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:34,590
This looks just like the ideal
gas, where the concentration

315
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,130
replaces the partial pressure.

316
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:43,360
Or the pressure of chemical A.
And you can go through, then

317
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:52,440
the same argument, where
you take your reaction.

318
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,370
And you initially have some
delta G for the reactants.

319
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:05,420
And you have some delta
G for the products.

320
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,830
And the difference is the delta
G for the reaction,

321
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:17,110
delta G naught for the reaction,
and then on this

322
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:26,510
side here, you have a solution
of A, so the reaction would be

323
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:30,390
nu A times A, which
is in a solution.

324
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:31,980
Temperature and pressure.

325
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,910
Plus nu B of reactant
B, in a solution,

326
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,340
temperature and pressure.

327
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:44,330
Going to a nu C, C solution,
temperature and pressure plus

328
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:48,560
nu D, D in a solution, constant

329
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,230
temperature and pressure.

330
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,420
So this is taking a solution
of A, in one container, a

331
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,150
solution of B in another
the container.

332
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:57,360
That's the initial point.

333
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:57,970
Mix them together.

334
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,690
Let them react.

335
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,580
Then you take the product,
you put them in separate

336
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,640
containers.

337
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,770
And that gets you the stuff that
you have the reaction.

338
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:09,980
So when you mix A and B, you're
going to have the same

339
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
entropy of mixing.

340
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,100
You're going to lower the delta
G. Of the solution.

341
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,640
And you're going to have
the same curve that

342
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,530
goes down like this.

343
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:21,890
To the mixture of products.

344
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,630
And just like for the gases,
where we wanted to know what

345
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:26,360
is the bottom of this curve
which gives us the

346
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,480
equilibrium, we can
do the same thing.

347
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:34,110
Exactly the same thing,
for solutions.

348
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:37,050
And so we start out with a
mixture of the A and B in

349
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,470
solution and C and D, reactants

350
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:41,070
and products together.

351
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:45,650
And we let the reaction
proceed a little bit.

352
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:53,030
And we look at the change in
delta G, going from, say this

353
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,130
point here through
that point here.

354
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,570
This will be delta
G of epsilon.

355
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,600
We ask, is this positive,
negative, or zero.

356
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,100
And if it's zero, that means
that we're in equilibrium,

357
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,150
that we're actually
sitting down here.

358
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:09,420
And that gives us the
equilibrium constant.

359
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:13,280
So, just for the sake of
completeness, let me just

360
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,730
write down what we would do.

361
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:20,240
We would react it for
a small amount.

362
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,530
And then we'd end
up with nu C.

363
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:28,050
So you would have the chemical
potentials of the products

364
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:33,480
minus the chemical potentials
of the reactants, nu C mu C,

365
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:44,160
plus nu D mu D, minus nu A mu
A, minus nu B mu B. And

366
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,680
instead of these chemical
potentials, you would write

367
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,130
them in terms of the pure
chemical potentials times

368
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:55,630
their concentrations.

369
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:01,470
And then you'd end up with
epsilon times delta G naught

370
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:10,360
of the reaction, plus RT log,
and then the concentrations.

371
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,450
And then you write them
in a different way.

372
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:15,380
So if it's moles per liter, you
usually write that with

373
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,240
these brackets here.

374
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,940
That means concentration of A
in moles per liter, I'd say.

375
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:29,420
So C to the nu C power, D to the
nu D power, A to the nu A

376
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,110
power, and B to the nu
B power, in these

377
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:37,370
concentrations.

378
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:41,420
Where this ratio of logs comes
from expanding out the

379
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,380
chemical potential here.

380
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,750
And there's the log term here.

381
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,670
Just like an ideal gas.

382
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,070
Then at equilibrium, this is
equal to zero, you're at the

383
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,620
bottom of that curve.

384
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,350
And you set these two things
equal to each other.

385
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:04,880
And you get the chemical,
you get your equation

386
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,200
that you know well.

387
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:11,550
For the equilibrium constant.

388
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,050
And this time it's not K sub
p, it's just K. And that's

389
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:19,700
what you know from doing
solution equilibrium.

390
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,390
And it's just like V.

391
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,810
So the thing to remember, which
is the slightly more

392
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:32,520
advanced part, which you'll have
to worry about at some

393
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,820
point if you stay in some sort
of biochemistry oriented

394
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:41,060
field, is that you've got to
reference your initial

395
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,340
solution properly.

396
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:48,150
To get to the right equilibrium
constant.

397
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:53,960
OK, any questions?

398
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,260
Alright, then now we can do the
temperature dependence of

399
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:02,900
the equilibrium constant
in a general way.

400
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,260
Whether it be a gas
or a solution.

401
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,160
It doesn't matter.

402
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:13,970
It's going to be
the same thing.

403
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,080
So the question that we ask now
is, suppose that I change

404
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,320
the temperature of my
equilibrium, which way is the

405
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,990
equilibrium going to shift?

406
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,580
And you all know the answer
already, probably.

407
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,010
But let's derive it out.

408
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,010
So we're going to want to know
basically, we want to know

409
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:35,260
what is dKp/dT.

410
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,850
How does equilibrium constant,
or dK/dT, if you're doing

411
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:45,150
solution, how does the
equilibrium change with

412
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,230
temperature?

413
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,880
What's the slope?

414
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,090
Is it positive, negative?

415
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,350
If we have this, we can
integrate it out.

416
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:53,560
We can do an integral
over temperature.

417
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,380
And get an actual change.

418
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,540
So that's our goal.

419
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,670
To find how the equilibrium
constant changes with

420
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,350
temperature.

421
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,220
What do we know?

422
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:11,640
Well, we know how Kp depends
on temperature, through the

423
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,740
Gibbs free energy
of the reaction.

424
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,780
The Gibbs free energy, delta
G naught, has a temperature

425
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,060
dependence.

426
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,700
And then there's an RT sitting
on the bottom.

427
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,890
There's another temperature
dependence here.

428
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:27,000
Well, dKp/dT is sort of like,
we could also ask

429
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,990
what's d log Kp dT.

430
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,500
That might be an easier
question.

431
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,810
It's basically the
same question.

432
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,010
Especially since we have
something which is log K, is

433
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:35,830
equal to something.

434
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,320
So let's ask this question
instead.

435
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,580
Let's ask, what is
d log Kp dT?

436
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:48,380
Alright, so let's differentiate
both sides.

437
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,880
d/dT, d/dT here.

438
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,950
Got to use the chain rule now.

439
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,490
Because we've got temperature
as part of

440
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:04,270
delta G Write it out.

441
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:05,930
So let's take the derivative
with respect to the

442
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,180
temperature on the
bottom first.

443
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,710
We have delta G naught, which is
a function of temperature,

444
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:14,100
divided by RT squared.

445
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:17,250
The minus sign here disappears
when you take the derivative

446
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,960
on the bottom.

447
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:30,160
Minus one over RT, d/dT
of delta G naught.

448
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,840
So this is a derivative
of delta G, where zero

449
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,370
means here one bar.

450
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,210
Fixed at one bar.

451
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:46,490
So really, d/dT, with delta G
naught fixed on one bar, is

452
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:50,130
the same thing as the partial
derivative of delta G with

453
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:53,605
respect to temperature, keeping
p is equal to constant

454
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:55,650
at one bar.

455
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,620
It's the same thing, just
different notation.

456
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:05,530
And we know what this is.

457
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:12,540
In terms of other things that
we can find in books, like

458
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:16,960
delta H, or delta S. Because
we can go to

459
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,900
the fundamental equations.

460
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:27,370
To find out how delta G depends
on temperature.

461
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:31,170
And our goal is to get rid of
delta G, which clearly has a

462
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:33,790
nice temperature dependence
through the entropy term.

463
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:36,510
And to replace delta G with
delta H, if we can.

464
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,750
Because delta h is going to
be much less sensitive to

465
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,390
temperature and it's, delta H
is going to be over small

466
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,700
temperature ranges, is going
to be independent of

467
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,100
temperature.

468
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,380
And we know the temperature
dependence of delta H, because

469
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,020
it's through the heat
capacities.

470
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,150
So our goal is to get rid
of this delta G here.

471
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,430
And to try to replace it with
delta H, if at all possible.

472
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:04,260
So we go to the fundamental
equation for G, dG is equal to

473
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:10,100
minus S dT plus V dp.

474
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:17,800
And sitting right here is
dG/dT at constant p.

475
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,940
Which is what we have here.

476
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:25,110
So we get rid of this derivative
of G. And replace

477
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:35,890
it with S. So now, now we have
d log Kp dT, and I mentioned

478
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,890
already that I want to get rid
of G. Because it has a strong

479
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:39,680
temperature dependence.

480
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,490
And I want to somehow get H in
there, which is not going to

481
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,130
have a strong temperature
dependence.

482
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,625
And delta G naught, I can write
in terms of H and S, and

483
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:56,410
T. Delta H naught minus
T delta S naught

484
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,630
divided by RT squared.

485
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:04,800
And then my derivative here,
I have minus one over RT.

486
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,890
Partial of G with respect to
T. p is equal to one bar.

487
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:13,080
Well, that's just delta S. p
is equal to one bar, well,

488
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,260
that's just delta S naught.

489
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:20,660
Times delta S naught.

490
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,800
And that's great, because
now there's minus T

491
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,920
divided by RT squared.

492
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,080
That's one over RT.

493
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,340
And somewhere I've
lost a sign.

494
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,300
And there's my sign that
I lost, right there.

495
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:40,580
This minus sign here. d/dT of
delta G naught is minus S. It

496
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,000
actually includes this minus
sign right here.

497
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,650
Which is great, because now
things work out, because this

498
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,090
becomes a plus sign.

499
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:54,460
And this and this cancel out.

500
00:30:54,460 --> 00:31:03,380
And this becomes delta H
naught over RT squared.

501
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,300
Great, so we have
what we want.

502
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,320
We have how the equilibrium
constant depends on

503
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,050
temperature in a way which
is very clear.

504
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:13,110
Where the top part is only
very weakly dependent on

505
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,740
temperature, usually.

506
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:23,160
And this is called the
van 't Hoff equation.

507
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,900
And this will tell us what
happens to equilibrium when we

508
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:30,340
change the temperature.

509
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,710
So if you want to do a finite
temperature change, now what

510
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:52,700
you need to do is, you
need to integrate.

511
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:59,320
You integrate both sides here.

512
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,520
From some T1 to T2.

513
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,880
From T1 to T2, and that tells
you, then, that the log of the

514
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,480
equilibrium constant at the new
temperature is equal to

515
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,650
the log of the equilibrium
constant of the old

516
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:21,310
temperature, T1, plus the
integral from T1 to T2 of

517
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:28,180
delta H over RT delta H naught,
over RT squared.

518
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,690
And this could be slightly
temperature dependent. dT.

519
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,810
And this is the integrated
van 't Hoff equation.

520
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:39,480
And if you're going to be
designing a chemical plant

521
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,810
where you have high temperatures
and high

522
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:48,070
pressures around, you
better use that.

523
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,070
Because there is some
temperature dependence in

524
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:53,150
delta H, through the heat
capacities of the reactants

525
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:54,460
and the products.

526
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:57,880
And that could make the
difference between your plant

527
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,750
running nice and smoothly
or your plant exploding.

528
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:04,210
And you don't want to have
exploding plants around.

529
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:10,160
So for heavy-duty uses of this
equation, you've got to do the

530
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,800
integral properly.

531
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,830
But for most normal
applications, like if you're

532
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,030
doing biology, where the
temperature changes by a few

533
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:19,730
degrees, like today I have
a little bit of a cold.

534
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,500
I don't have a fever, but
I could have a fever.

535
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,050
So my biochemistry would change
if I had a fever.

536
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,420
The equilibrium constant of all
my reactions would change

537
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,820
a little bit.

538
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,350
It's a small change
in temperature.

539
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:34,640
I'm not going to explode.

540
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,330
And so you can then take
the approximation.

541
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:47,140
In that case, the delta H
naught, is independent of T.

542
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:53,960
And this is fine over small
temperature ranges.

543
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,940
And that's the one that
you're most used to.

544
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,770
Is this approximation
here, this

545
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,020
approximate van 't Hoff equation.

546
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:02,860
Which is really fine for most
cases that you're going to be

547
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:05,870
dealing with.

548
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:09,190
So then, if that's the case then
you can take your delta

549
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,830
H. Ignore the temperature
dependence and take it outside

550
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,210
of the integral.

551
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,370
And now you can do the
integral fine.

552
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:21,190
And then you have an analytic
expression for the change in

553
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,600
the equilibrium constant
with temperature.

554
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:29,170
Log Kp at a new temperature, T2,
is log Kp temperature T1.

555
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:31,610
And I'm carrying this little
p around everywhere.

556
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,410
But really, it doesn't
have to be there.

557
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,180
This could be solution.

558
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,450
I shouldn't really have written
this for the specific

559
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,240
case of partial pressures.

560
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,090
But it's equally valid
for solutions.

561
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:46,970
Then we have delta H naught over
R. And then we have the

562
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:51,430
integral from T1 to T2, over
one of RT squared.

563
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,520
And if you do that the
right way, you get T2

564
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,610
minus T1 over T1 T2.

565
00:34:57,610 --> 00:35:00,020
And that gives you the

566
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,280
approximate van 't Hoff equation.

567
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,480
Which is fine.

568
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,080
And you'll know that it's fine
in problem sets or exam,

569
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,450
because we'll say assume that
delta H is temperature - yes.

570
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:18,940
STUDENT: You said that
the [INAUDIBLE]

571
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,740
PROFESSOR: For K, if
K is solution K.

572
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,260
STUDENT: Right.

573
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

574
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:26,930
STUDENT: So then, can
you also use Kx?

575
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,450
PROFESSOR: Can you use Kx?

576
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:33,140
Well, as long as you keep the
pressure, the total pressure,

577
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:38,720
constant, then you should
be able to use Kx.

578
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:43,920
Let me think about this.

579
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,100
Yeah, here you would have p, you
have a log c so, you can

580
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:47,840
use Kx, fine.

581
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,560
Because then you would have log
p to the minus delta nu

582
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,890
times Kx, log p to the
delta nu minus Kx.

583
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,770
And the log of the
multiplication is

584
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,380
the sum of the logs.

585
00:35:58,380 --> 00:35:59,440
And the logs will
just fall out.

586
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,460
So it could be any
K that you want.

587
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,080
Doesn't matter.

588
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,190
As long as you keep the
pressure constant.

589
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:10,630
If you change the pressure,
then you're in trouble.

590
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,660
So now we can see what happens
when you do change the

591
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,280
temperature.

592
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:25,420
If I have some equilibrium, and
it's all going to depend

593
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,020
on the sign of delta H. Whether
the reaction is

594
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:33,200
exothermic or endothermic.

595
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,340
And it's the same thing as Le
Chatelier's for pressure, or

596
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,090
Lenz's law.

597
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,300
The system doesn't want to
have change happening.

598
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,430
So if you have something that's,
delta H is less than

599
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,810
zero, it's exothermic.

600
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:51,750
Exothermic, that means that
it's putting out heat. it

601
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:55,300
wants to heat up its
environment.

602
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,990
And if I take temperature and
I raise the temperature, the

603
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:02,130
system's not going to
like that very much.

604
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,540
It doesn't want to get hotter,
and going from reactants to

605
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,550
products makes things hotter.

606
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:09,520
And if you go from products to

607
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,980
reactants, that's the opposite.

608
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,840
Go from reactants to products,
that becomes endothermic.

609
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,420
It sucks in heat.

610
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,610
You raise the temperature.

611
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,210
The system said no, no, no,
I'm happy where I am at my

612
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,450
original temperature.

613
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:22,960
I'm going to start sucking in
heat, to try to get the

614
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,810
temperature down.

615
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,630
And it's going to try to
make more product.

616
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,250
More reactants.

617
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:40,170
So, equilibrium K is going to go
down. and the reaction goes

618
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,810
towards the reactants.

619
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,090
And the opposite if you have
something that's endothermic

620
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,670
to begin with.

621
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,230
OK, delta H is positive here.

622
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:54,650
Delta H naught is positive.

623
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,850
You raise the temperature, delta
H naught is positive,

624
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,590
T2's bigger.

625
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,620
This is a positive number.

626
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:06,910
K becomes larger at higher
temperature.

627
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,850
K goes up.

628
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,900
The reaction goes to products.

629
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:15,210
So if you think of it in terms
of the system, the system is

630
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,960
at some temperature.

631
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,820
You raise the temperature.

632
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,500
System doesn't like it.

633
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,910
Says, I want to go back
to my original

634
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,520
temperature, what can I do.

635
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,690
I can try to suck in heat that
you're trying to put in the

636
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,970
environment.

637
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,630
That's great because if I make
more products, that's

638
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:32,730
endothermic.

639
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:34,810
And I'm just going to make more
products until I try to

640
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:35,740
lower my temperature.

641
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:41,740
So I move the equilibrium
to the products.

642
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:56,130
OK, Le Chatelier for
temperature.

643
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:59,910
Any questions?

644
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:08,300
On equilibrium.

645
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,970
OK, let's do a quick example.

646
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:13,410
Because this was the example
that we started out with,

647
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,760
talking about, the
Haber process.

648
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:21,570
This important industrial
reaction that started the

649
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,670
chemical industry,
essentially.

650
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:27,860
That uses up 1%, or close to
1%, of the world's energy.

651
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,740
If you think about it, that's
an amazing number.

652
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,960
1% of all energy
produced in the

653
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:35,110
world goes to one reaction.

654
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,050
One industrial reaction.

655
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:45,430
Just shows how important
it is.

656
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:47,210
OK, why does it take
so much energy?

657
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,260
We're going to find out.

658
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:55,310
We're going to find out why it
takes so much energy to run

659
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,500
this here reaction.

660
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:00,100
Alright, let's look at
this Haber process.

661
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,990
Take some nitrogen gas.

662
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:11,270
Plus some hydrogen gas.

663
00:40:11,270 --> 00:40:14,380
And this is usually done over
catalysts, like an iron oxide

664
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,850
catalyst or something.

665
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,090
To try to speed it up.

666
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,330
It doesn't change the
thermodynamics.

667
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,070
As you know, and you'll hear
again in this class, catalysts

668
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,140
just affect the kinetics.

669
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,330
They don't change the
thermodynamics.

670
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,950
So this is usually done over
some catalyst to try to

671
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,220
speed things up.

672
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,450
To make ammonia.

673
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:35,200
And ammonia becomes the
feedstock for fertilizers, for

674
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,310
almost anything that contains
an amine in it, or

675
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:38,680
a nitrogen in it.

676
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:42,090
If you're going to make
proteins or whatever.

677
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,740
You've got to have ammonia
somewhere in the process.

678
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:48,470
OK, delta H naught of the
reaction, we're given all

679
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:50,210
these numbers.

680
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:54,630
At 298 degrees Kelvin.

681
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,080
And they're in your notes, so
I'm not going to go through

682
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,390
them in detail.

683
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,890
Delta G naught for
the reaction,

684
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,940
we're given that number.

685
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,810
At 298 degrees Kelvin, that's
minus 16, roughly minus 16

686
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:12,340
kilojoules per mole.

687
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,500
And we want to know, what is
the equilibrium constant.

688
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,430
Room temperature.

689
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,880
So you know how to
calculate that.

690
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,760
Minus RT log Kp, log K
is equal to minus RT.

691
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,110
Minus delta G naught over RT.

692
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:30,340
So you put that in there.

693
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,530
You get Kp is equal to 860.

694
00:41:33,530 --> 00:41:35,170
A number, no units.

695
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,820
It's a big number.

696
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,800
It's a big number, you've
got the products

697
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,500
divided by the reactants.

698
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,450
It means that the products
are favored.

699
00:41:42,450 --> 00:41:45,160
This is great.

700
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,760
What a wonderful reaction.

701
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,340
Shouldn't take energy to for
us to do that, right?

702
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,090
It's a room temperature
reaction.

703
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,560
Thermodynamics is great.

704
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:59,570
But even over a catalyst, this
is a really, really, really

705
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,230
slow reaction.

706
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,590
We'd still be waiting here for
Mr. Haber to produce his first

707
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:08,190
mole of amine, if you were doing
it, or ammonia if we

708
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:10,040
were doing it at room
temperature.

709
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:13,770
It's just so slow.

710
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:16,380
Thus, not at all practical.

711
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,620
We're not going to run the
world on room temperature

712
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,840
Haber process.

713
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,710
But it turns out, if you raise
the temperature, kinetics is

714
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:29,240
wonderful in terms of the
temperature dependence.

715
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,180
It's exponential.

716
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,620
Arrhenius rate law.

717
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:34,970
Great thing, you raise the
temperature by a little bit.

718
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,190
Rates speed up, things
go faster.

719
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:39,750
So if you were to raise the
temperature from 298 degrees

720
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:49,050
Kelvin to 800 degrees Kelvin,
the rate speeds up.

721
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:50,540
You're going to need
some energy.

722
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,620
As input here, to feed that.

723
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,510
Hence the 1% energy use.

724
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,750
Rate speeds up, that's great.

725
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,030
Things happen faster.

726
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:00,930
It becomes practical.

727
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:04,600
But, what happens if you
raise the temperature?

728
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:04,910
Let's see.

729
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,380
This is an endothermic, or
exothermic, negative sign.

730
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,740
And negative sign's
exothermic.

731
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:12,780
I raise the temperature,
K goes down.

732
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,590
I know how to calculate
it here.

733
00:43:14,590 --> 00:43:17,090
And if I want to be super
careful, because it's a fairly

734
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:20,420
large temperature range, I can
even use the exact form of the

735
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:21,280
van 't Hoff equation.

736
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,110
And what I find, if I do that,
and putting the heat

737
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,190
capacities for all these
gases, I find

738
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,150
that Kp does go down.

739
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,310
In fact, it goes down
quite a bit.

740
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:39,050
It becomes 0.0007.

741
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,580
Two zero's.

742
00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:43,350
Still really small.

743
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,560
That's not practical.

744
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,510
Not practical at all.

745
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,440
No good.

746
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,810
We can't run an industrial plant
with this kind of yield.

747
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,290
There's just no way it's
going to work.

748
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,190
So, you're a chemical
engineer.

749
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,350
Or a chemist, like Haber
and Bosch were.

750
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:05,510
And you're trying, you know by
Le Chatelier, you know that it

751
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:07,310
went in the wrong direction
for you here.

752
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,070
And then you look at your
reaction and you say, how many

753
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:12,180
moles of reactants do I have?

754
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,860
3/2 plus 1/2, that's two
moles of reactants.

755
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:18,040
And I've got one mole
of product.

756
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,600
Two moles reactants, one
mole of product.

757
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,720
Two moles reactant...

758
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,060
What happens if I change
the pressure?

759
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:27,040
If I change the pressure, if I
increase the pressure, the

760
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,480
system is going to say,
no, I don't want

761
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,050
the pressure increased.

762
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,520
It's going to go to where
there's less moles.

763
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,070
And the less moles in
the product area.

764
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:37,420
It's going to go
to my product.

765
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,020
That's great.

766
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:39,710
I've got to increase
the pressure.

767
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:40,220
Wonderful.

768
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,710
Let's start increasing
the pressure.

769
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,710
Again, we need some
energy to do that.

770
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,380
We're going to go from one bar
to some higher pressure.

771
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,020
It's going to make our lives
more complicated.

772
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,390
The plant might explode now.

773
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,890
If the pressure's too high.

774
00:44:50,890 --> 00:44:53,230
All sorts of problems going
to come into play.

775
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,660
But, let's do it.

776
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,790
Let's increase the pressure.

777
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:10,280
So, you increase the pressure
from one bar to 100 bar.

778
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:18,160
And you calculate Kx.

779
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:20,420
Which is really what you want.

780
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:24,730
So Kx, in this case here,
is equal to p times Kp.

781
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,770
Kp doesn't change.

782
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,590
Kp doesn't care what the
total pressure is.

783
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:29,190
It's Kx that cares.

784
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:32,800
At one bar, Kx is equal Kp.

785
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,050
Kx is p to the minus delta nu.

786
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:40,130
Number of moles of products
minus the number of reactants.

787
00:45:40,130 --> 00:45:47,950
If I go from one bar to 100
bars, Kx goes from 0.007 to

788
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:53,320
100 times 0.007, which
is equal to 0.7.

789
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,970
That's a lot better.

790
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,340
Kx is the mole fraction
or the, of

791
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,860
products divided by reactants.

792
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:09,220
And if I go to p is equal to 300
bars, then Kx goes to 2.1.

793
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:11,960
three times 0.7.

794
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,870
This is great.

795
00:46:12,870 --> 00:46:14,630
Now I'm really starting
to make good products.

796
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:16,670
But I've got to go to 300 bar.

797
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:22,300
I've got to go to 300 bar,
and 800 degrees Kelvin.

798
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:25,500
That is incredibly
energy-intensive.

799
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,330
But it works.

800
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,170
That's why Haber and Bosch
made this work.

801
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:32,500
And why Germany stayed in the
war longer than after 1916.

802
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,180
The first world war.

803
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,840
Ended in 1918.

804
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:41,240
Nobel Prizes.

805
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,910
Merck, Bayer, all these
german companies.

806
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,770
Because they figured how to do
this at high pressure and high

807
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,510
temperature.

808
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:54,450
Without blowing everything up.

809
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:55,910
OK.

810
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:01,710
Any questions?

811
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:02,000
Alright.

812
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,560
The last topic is, so far we've
seen equilibria where

813
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,770
you had things that
were well mixed.

814
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,470
equilibria of ideal gases.

815
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:14,730
Or in solutions, where your
solutes, your solute molecules

816
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,440
are mixing around.

817
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:20,590
And the entropy of mixing was
really super important.

818
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,260
Our curve, our going down for
delta G, was all because of

819
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,440
the entropy of mixing.

820
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:28,610
Now, suppose that I have a
heterogeneous mixture.

821
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:32,230
I've got some solids or some
pure liquids that are refusing

822
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:35,930
to share their environment.

823
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,680
And staying as pure materials.

824
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,870
So, for instance, if I have
a beaker with some solid

825
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:45,770
reactant on the bottom here.

826
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:55,080
And the products are
in solution.

827
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,440
How do I deal with
that equilibrium?

828
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,030
Well, you know the answer, but
let's just do it out again.

829
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:04,470
So we're going to have nu
A moles of A, of solid.

830
00:48:04,470 --> 00:48:06,270
Not mixed in the solution.

831
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:08,400
Let's say we have multiple
phases here.

832
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,980
Nu B moles of B,
which is a gas.

833
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:13,760
Instead of a solution, let's
do a gas phase reaction.

834
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,540
Nu C moles of C, which
is a pure liquid.

835
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,020
And nu D moles of D,
which is a gas.

836
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,280
So these two gases can mix.

837
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,580
But the pure solid and the
pure liquid can't mix.

838
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:28,650
So let's think again, where
does the equilibrium

839
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:29,460
constant come from?

840
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:34,310
It comes from looking at this
delta G of the mixture and

841
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,210
letting it react a
little bit more.

842
00:48:36,210 --> 00:48:39,905
And taking out these chemical
potentials for the species and

843
00:48:39,905 --> 00:48:40,750
the mixture.

844
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:46,460
Expanding it out in terms of
log p or log concentration.

845
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,360
So we need to have
this delta G in.

846
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,100
Let's take epsilon equal
to one, to make our

847
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:51,800
life simpler here.

848
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:57,740
So now we have nu C
mu C of the pure.

849
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,350
The pure solid.

850
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,740
Plus nu D mu C of the gas.

851
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:07,150
Which is in the mixture.

852
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:14,220
Minus nu A mu A of the
pure liquid, minus nu

853
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,860
B mu B of the gas.

854
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,200
Which is in the mixture.

855
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:24,190
That's what this delta G is,
when we allow the reaction to

856
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:27,380
proceed for a little bit more.

857
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,300
We add a little bit of chemical

858
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,890
potentials from the products.

859
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:32,210
Subtract a little
bit of chemical

860
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:34,370
potential from the reactants.

861
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,330
And then we expand it out in
terms of the standard chemical

862
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,950
potentials for everything
being pure.

863
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:41,720
Entropy of mixing
comes in here.

864
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,610
Comes in here.

865
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:46,300
Delta G of mixing
comes in here.

866
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:54,860
And we end up with something
that looks like nu C mu C

867
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:02,760
naught, plus nu D mu D naught,
minus nu A mu A naught, minus

868
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,670
nu B mu B naught.

869
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,730
Plus RT log, and the only place
where we have these log

870
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,590
p's, or log concentration
coming in, is for those

871
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,640
species that were not pure.

872
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,930
And those are only these
two guys here.

873
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:22,340
The ones that are in
the gas phase.

874
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:26,820
D and B. So we end up with
partial pressure of D to the

875
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:27,770
nu D power.

876
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:32,500
Partial pressure of B,
to the nu B power.

877
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,560
The other two species
don't come in there.

878
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,630
Because they started
out as pure.

879
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:39,360
There's no mixing going on.

880
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:44,060
And there's no expansion
of the log for them.

881
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:49,985
And so now, when we look at the
Q for the reaction, the

882
00:50:49,985 --> 00:50:52,010
reaction quotient, it
doesn't contain

883
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,050
any of the pure species.

884
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,950
It only contains those species
that are allowed to mix.

885
00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,440
Those that are in the gas
phase or in solution.

886
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:08,350
And so K, then, for this
reaction only takes in those

887
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:14,780
products like D. Or reactants
like B, which

888
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,380
are in the gas phase.

889
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,170
The pure solids or pure
liquids don't come in.

890
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:19,640
They come in for
delta G naught.

891
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:23,090
There's delta G naught
sitting right here.

892
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:26,850
Delta G naught for
the reaction is

893
00:51:26,850 --> 00:51:28,650
sitting right there.

894
00:51:28,650 --> 00:51:32,365
So when you write your log K
is equal to minus delta G

895
00:51:32,365 --> 00:51:36,940
naught over RT, the delta G
naught has everything in it.

896
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,710
The pure stuff, the solution
stuff, the gas phase stuff.

897
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:44,570
But the K only has the gas
phase and solution stuff.

898
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:49,560
Alright, any questions?

899
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:49,760
Good.

900
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,900
Next time we'll do an example.

901
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,130
And then we'll go on
phase transitions.
