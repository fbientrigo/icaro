8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,900
PROFESSOR NELSON: Over the last
couple lectures through

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,400
our consideration of a number of
somewhat difficult topics,

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,930
including these Carnot cycles
and specific Carnot engine to

11
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:36,970
represent them, we've tried to
define and understand a little

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:44,250
bit about this very special
function, this entropy.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,860
Where we've got our dS.

14
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:56,960
It's dq reversible over T. And
our treatment of reversible

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,320
and irreversible cyclic
processes, what we saw is that

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:16,460
if we go around a cycle and look
at dq reversible over T,

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,250
then this is zero.

18
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,830
Now go all the way around a
cycle, of course, this is just

19
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,160
delta S for the cycle.

20
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,890
And that's consistent
with the idea that

21
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,070
entropy is a state functions.

22
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,430
So if we go around cycle the
cycle, we have the same ending

23
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,936
point, the starting point, same
state, then the change in

24
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:39,420
the state function
has to be zero.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:48,140
But we saw that for an
irreversible path around a

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:55,540
cycle, then we have
that, this gives

27
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,920
something less than zero.

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,610
And so that was expressed in
Clausius inequality that

29
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:08,140
includes both these cases.

30
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,830
And now I just want to go
through a number of

31
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,440
calculations of entropy.

32
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,480
How entropy changes for a number
processes, both to just

33
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,830
learn more about it in general
terms and also just to see how

34
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,060
it's calculated and what sort
of changes in undergoes for

35
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,770
different sorts of
changes in state.

36
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:31,560
So the first very general
example that I want to show is

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,270
the following.

38
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:46,180
Let's say we've got an isolated
system, and it

39
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:57,780
undergoes some irreversible
change.

40
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:09,050
So we'll start at one, and we'll
go irreversibly to some

41
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:19,070
new state, two.

42
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:29,090
OK, now we can always return the
system back to the initial

43
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:36,760
state reversibly.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,040
If we do that, then we can't
keep the system isolated.

45
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,760
So it won't be isolated
anymore.

46
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,260
In other words, in order to
arrange things so that you

47
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,460
could have a return
along a reversible

48
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,130
path, it can't be isolated.

49
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:56,190
In some sense you know that,
because when it was isolated

50
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,520
it spontaneously irreversibly
went from one to two.

51
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,260
And example would be ice melting
at some temperature

52
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,500
that might be higher than
the freezing point.

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,310
So you've got solid ice, but the
temperature is above zero

54
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,180
degrees Celsius, so irreversibly
it'll melt.

55
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,710
Systems isolated, it'll melt.

56
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,790
Then you could put the system
in contact with a cold

57
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,930
reservoir reversibly re-freeze
the water to form ice again.

58
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,230
But of course to do that you
couldn't keep it isolated.

59
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:30,270
You need to have it in contact
with a low temperature bath.

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,190
But again, this is
just completely

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,100
general at this point.

62
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,380
It's some irreversible process
returned then along a

63
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,520
reversible path.

64
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,210
So let's just look
at what happens.

65
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:51,360
So here's our path B.
Along path A, well

66
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,580
it's an isolated system.

67
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,480
So the heat exchanged is zero.

68
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:10,230
And then, for the cycle based
on the Clausius inequality

69
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:21,480
expressed here, the integral
around the cycle of dq over T

70
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,610
in general, it's less than
or equal to zero.

71
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,890
If there was an irreversible
process involved, then in

72
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,810
fact, it'll be less than zero.

73
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,940
I'll write it here in the more
general case, but we know what

74
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:40,110
it's really going to be with
the irreversible step.

75
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,380
Well, so we can write this
as the integral of dq

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:58,920
irreversible over T, going from
state one to state two.

77
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:04,720
Oh, let me rewrite
this down here.

78
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:12,450
So around the cycle, dq over
T, it's integral from state

79
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:20,390
one to two of dq irreversible
over T, plus the integral from

80
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:28,120
two back to one of dq reversible
over T. And of

81
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,970
course, we know that that's less
than or equal to zero.

82
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,740
But this, we know is zero,
right, because this

83
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,990
irreversible step is
taken in isolation.

84
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,070
The system is isolated.

85
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,550
We've already seen that there's
no heat crossing the

86
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,420
boundary of the system.

87
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:48,110
So we just have this.

88
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:57,060
So of course this dq reversible
over T from two to

89
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,930
one, that's, what now we've a
reversible path, so that's

90
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,830
just the entropy at the delta
S going from two to one.

91
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:11,660
It's S1 minus S2 it's delta S,
we can write it as delta S

92
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,450
backwards, right, we're
going back along

93
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,460
that reversible path.

94
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,580
Which is of course negative
delta S forward.

95
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,880
Because around the whole cycle
delta s has to be zero.

96
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:43,580
So what that says is delta S
forward is greater than or

97
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:50,120
equal to zero.

98
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,260
That's interesting.

99
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,160
What that's saying is --
remember, we didn't specify

100
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,760
the process.

101
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,600
It's just for any completely
general irreversible process.

102
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,320
For any such process, for any
spontaneous process, this is

103
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,070
going to be the case.

104
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:14,360
So in other words, for an
isolated system, delta S tells

105
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,710
us the direction of spontaneous
change.

106
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:29,180
In particular, for the isolated
system, delta S is

107
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:40,590
greater than zero for something
that's irreversible.

108
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:51,330
Delta S equals zero for
something that's reversible,

109
00:08:51,330 --> 00:09:02,200
and delta S is never
less than zero.

110
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,180
In a sense, this is a direct
consequence of the Clausius

111
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:11,720
inequality.

112
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,200
That's a pretty useful result.

113
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,450
So remember when we started this
whole discussion, I tried

114
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:25,200
to emphasize that the first law
of thermodynamics told us

115
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,020
about conservation of energy.

116
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:30,280
But it didn't tell us which
way something would go

117
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,620
spontaneously if you just left
the system to its own devices

118
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,430
under certain conditions.

119
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:40,440
This is telling us that.

120
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,450
We can tell which way the system
will evolve in which

121
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:46,680
direction it'll go.

122
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,530
This is for an isolated system
and we'll generalize this in

123
00:09:50,530 --> 00:10:00,570
subsequent lectures.

124
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:06,090
Now, let's look at what
happens if the

125
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,920
system isn't isolated.

126
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:25,710
So now let's go from one
to two not isolated.

127
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:31,550
So of course, delta S I'm
going to specify for the

128
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,420
system for reasons that'll soon
be obvious is S2 for the

129
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,610
system minus S1 for
the system.

130
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:42,360
Of course it doesn't depend on
the path, even though to

131
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:52,610
calculate it, we need to
find a reversible path.

132
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,610
Just to add emphasis to what we
just did here, of course,

133
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:57,590
it was the same thing.

134
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:02,440
In order to calculate delta S
along that irreversible path

135
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,380
for that irreversible process
we needed to construct some

136
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,270
reversible path.

137
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,670
And what we did is imagined
the reversible path going

138
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,310
backwards and then said, OK,
fine then delta S for the

139
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,180
irreversible process must be the
opposite of delta S that

140
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,120
we calculated along the

141
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,850
reversible bath going backwards.

142
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:24,820
The point is that to calculate
delta S in either direction,

143
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,690
we needed to construct
some reversible path.

144
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,650
All right, and of course
it'll be the same here.

145
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,960
Now, in this case since the
system isn't isolated, that

146
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,830
means heat's going to flow
across the boundary.

147
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:43,580
So that means heat is going
between, it's being exchanged

148
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,110
between the system and
the surroundings.

149
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:47,150
So what's happening to
the surroundings?

150
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:50,430
Generally, we've worry a lot
about the system, but not much

151
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,560
in recent discussions about
the surroundings.

152
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,520
But delta S surroundings
must be something.

153
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:04,360
We could calculate it.

154
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,500
And that's depends
on the path.

155
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,450
Not because it isn't the state
function in the surroundings,

156
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,300
of course it is, but because
depending on the path, the

157
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,650
final state of the

158
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:22,060
surroundings will be different.

159
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,550
After all, depending on how much
heat got exchanged, the

160
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:30,970
surroundings got more or
less of that heat.

161
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,780
Work might have been done
on the surroundings.

162
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:37,000
So the surroundings are going
to respond, are going to

163
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,040
change also, when the system
changes in this way and it's

164
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,990
not isolated.

165
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:44,640
And how the surroundings change
will depend on what

166
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,820
path was taken.

167
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,950
And you've seen that before
in calculating things like

168
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,450
pressure, volume, work along
different paths.

169
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,580
Where you calculated delta u for
the system and saw that it

170
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:59,230
was the same for different paths
but q and w were not the

171
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,330
same for the system, and
therefore, of course, not for

172
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:07,710
the surroundings either.

173
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:21,450
So let's just consider
an irreversible path.

174
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:23,300
And in order to think about
what happens to the

175
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,890
surroundings, let's take the
entire universe which consists

176
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:36,550
of the system and the
surroundings -- that is a big

177
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,400
isolated system, because
it's everything.

178
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:45,950
So it's not somehow in contact
with another additional body

179
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,000
or universe.

180
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,720
We can treat the
entire universe

181
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,100
as an isolated system.

182
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:05,690
So, we're going to think about
the entire universe.

183
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:13,890
We can think about it as
an isolated system.

184
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,050
Great.

185
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:23,400
And we know that delta S for
an isolated system, for a

186
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,230
spontaneous process, is
greater than zero.

187
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,130
That's right there.

188
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:38,050
So delta S for the universe
which is delta S for the

189
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:44,950
system plus delta S for the
surroundings, and I'll specify

190
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,130
since we're considering an
irreversible process, specify

191
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:52,150
that, it's greater than zero.

192
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:55,390
The whole thing happened
spontaneously, and the whole

193
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,790
universe is an isolated
system.

194
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:03,190
So if we wanted to, we can
write that delta S

195
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:07,320
irreversible for the
surroundings must be bigger

196
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:15,340
than minus delta S for the
system in order that there sum

197
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,590
be positive.

198
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,640
All right?

199
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:33,150
Now, if we consider a reversible
process, then of

200
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,160
course we already know what
happens for an isolated system

201
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,450
in a reversible process,
delta S is zero.

202
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:47,820
So delta S in this case of the
whole universe, which is delta

203
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,860
S for the system plus delta S
for the surroundings in the

204
00:15:53,860 --> 00:16:02,210
reversible case must
be equal to zero.

205
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:08,050
In other words, delta S of the
surroundings in the reversible

206
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:15,350
case is exactly the opposite
of delta S of the system.

207
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:18,230
Delta S of the system is the
same in either case because

208
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,380
reversible or irreversible,
we're specifying the system,

209
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,940
goes between the same states,
but what happens to the

210
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:30,790
surroundings is different
in the two cases.

211
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:36,590
So one way of recasting this
statement or the Clausius

212
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,080
inequality is the entropy
of the whole

213
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,720
universe never decreases.

214
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,370
Of course, in some sense,
that's obvious from this

215
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,800
statement, since we're
considering the universe an

216
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,670
isolated system.

217
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:56,900
So the entropy in any process
can, it can, the change in

218
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:04,950
entropy can either be zero or
positive and never negative.

219
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:27,700
So entropy off the whole
universe never decreases.

220
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,610
That's actually a really quite
profound conclusion.

221
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:36,580
All sorts of philosophical and
other consequences of it that

222
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,670
are sometimes considered in
things like evolutionary

223
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,090
biology and other things.

224
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,135
And how things can change
altogether an

225
00:17:43,135 --> 00:17:48,710
entire system of things.

226
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,140
Now, I'd like to just go through
a few calculations of

227
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,140
delta S for common processes.

228
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,970
We've seen a few general
features of entropy.

229
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,980
Let's calculate it
for a few things.

230
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:15,640
So calculations of
delta S. And we

231
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,700
know the general procedure.

232
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,240
Whatever the process is, we're
going to need to find

233
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,830
reversible paths, and along a
reversible path then, we'll be

234
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,480
able to calculate it.

235
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:39,230
One, let's just take two
pieces of material at

236
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:43,590
different temperatures.

237
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:56,350
The entire system is going
to be isolated.

238
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:01,010
And then let's connect them.

239
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:02,830
And then let's connect them.

240
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,480
Put some material
between them.

241
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,500
So now heat can flow from
one to the other.

242
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,410
And you know what's going to
happen which is if they start

243
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,340
out at unequal temperatures, and
you wait a little while,

244
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:11,020
eventually they're going
to wind up at the same

245
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,810
temperature.

246
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,850
In other words, you
know the direction

247
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,950
of spontaneous change.

248
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,950
So let's just see what
happens to delta S.

249
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:33,550
So isolated system, so there's
no work being done.

250
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,250
There's no heat that's
being exchanged.

251
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:42,060
So delta u is zero.

252
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,810
What's dS?

253
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,360
Well it's just the sum of the
changes in entropy for the two

254
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,450
sub-systems the two
separate pieces.

255
00:19:53,450 --> 00:20:03,880
So it's dq1 over T1 plus dq2
over T2, I think there's a

256
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,720
type in your notes. it's plus
not minus of course.

257
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,410
But in this case, dq1 is just
the opposite of dq2.

258
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:20,280
Because whatever heat is flowing
into T1, into this

259
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,770
block, is coming out of this
block, or vice versa,

260
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:32,490
depending on which
one is hotter.

261
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:39,070
So this is just equal to dq1
times one over T1 minus one

262
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:45,700
over T2, which is T2 minus
T1 over T1 times T2.

263
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,910
So that's dS, and then we could
integrate it to get the

264
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:56,380
delta S, but this is sufficient
for what I'd like

265
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:59,850
to illustrate, which is just
the sign of things.

266
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:09,140
We know dS must be greater than
zero for the spontaneous

267
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,920
change that's going to occur.

268
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,860
So let's just make sure that
common sense prevails here.

269
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,810
That says if T2 is greater than
T1, right T2 is hotter.

270
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,110
Then dq must be positive, so
this is positive, this is

271
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:30,240
positive, dS we know
has to be positive.

272
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,440
So, it says T2 is hotter.

273
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,790
This being positive means heat
is flowing in from this one to

274
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,230
this one, from the hotter
to the colder body.

275
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,210
So it looks right.

276
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,780
If T2 is lower than T1, if this
one is colder, then in

277
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,120
order for dS to be positive,
which it has to be, this

278
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,210
better be negative.

279
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:01,160
In other words, again heat is
going to flow from the hotter

280
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,810
toward the colder, into
the colder body.

281
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:11,890
So, as promised, the condition
that dS must be greater than

282
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:17,160
zero, guides us and tells us the
direction that spontaneous

283
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:21,050
change is going to occur.

284
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:24,170
We can tell just from this
condition which way things

285
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:44,530
have to evolve.

286
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,120
All right, let's try another
pretty simple process.

287
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:59,690
Let's just take a gas in some
volume V and over here is

288
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:05,400
going to be vacuum of equal
volume, and we're going to

289
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,630
remove the barrier.

290
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:10,260
You know what's going to happen
spontaneously, right?

291
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:14,490
The gas is going to fill the
available volume once it

292
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,540
becomes available.

293
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:23,870
So this, we'll make this a Joule
expansion, and we'll

294
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:29,230
make it an ideal gas.

295
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:37,590
So the process is one mole of
gas at our initial volume and

296
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:46,200
some temperature, and we'll make
this adiabatic, and this

297
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:53,360
goes to one mole of gas at a new
volume, 2V and at the same

298
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,750
temperature.

299
00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:01,350
All right, so there's
no work done.

300
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,220
It's adiabatic.

301
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,440
There's no heat exchanged.

302
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,330
Delta u is zero.

303
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,870
Everything's zero.

304
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:13,700
Almost everything is zero.

305
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,360
What isn't zero?

306
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:16,680
STUDENT: Entropy.

307
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:17,300
PROFESSOR NELSON: Entropy.

308
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,860
It's going to tell us which
way this whole thing goes.

309
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,730
So this is an irreversible
process.

310
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:26,020
In order to calculate delta
S we need to construct a

311
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,790
reversible path along
which this can go.

312
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,830
So here's a way to do it.

313
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,480
We could compress it back,
isothermally and reversibly.

314
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,190
Just like the example I gave,
the general example, where I

315
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,750
mentioned the ice melting.

316
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,140
In that case, it won't
be adiabatic.

317
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,240
We'd have to put it in
contact with a heat

318
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,840
source of some sort.

319
00:24:51,840 --> 00:25:00,420
So reversible process.

320
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:21,870
We could compress it back to
volume V, isothermally, and

321
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:22,880
reversibly.

322
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,860
Let me say, there's no -- we
wouldn't have to consider this

323
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,880
process in reverse.

324
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,400
Of course, we could also
consider the forward process

325
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,480
in the presence of some heat
source with isn't isolated and

326
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,670
do this, but let's just consider
the compression.

327
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:46,450
So, OK, now we'll have
the -- well, once

328
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,930
again, delta u is zero.

329
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,090
It's an ideal gas.

330
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,530
There's no temperature change.

331
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,150
But this time q and w aren't
going to be zero.

332
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,270
They're going to be some
finite numbers that are

333
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,310
opposites of each other.

334
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:05,750
Because we're no longer
isolated.

335
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:19,360
So let's just write out delta
S to go backward is dq

336
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:28,210
reversible over T, and
that's minus dw

337
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:32,550
over T, not zero anymore.

338
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:39,420
And where we're going is from
2V to V, we're compressing,

339
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,670
and it's an ideal gas.

340
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:59,620
So this is the same as p dV, but
it's p dV over T which is

341
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,960
the same thing as going from
2V to V. Now we're going to

342
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,110
replace this with RT over V,
and the T's will cancel.

343
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:16,770
So it's R dV over V going from
2V to one V. So it's just R

344
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:23,440
times the log of 1/2.

345
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,190
So now we've just calculated
the value of delta S by

346
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,080
constructing this
reversible path.

347
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,260
Now this is delta S backward.

348
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,070
To do the compression, so of
course delta S forward is just

349
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:46,930
the opposite of that.

350
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:58,460
So, delta S forward
is R log 2.

351
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:12,920
Reassuringly, that's
a positive number.

352
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,830
So this process that we
considered originally, this

353
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:20,370
irreversibly process in this
isolated system, remember, for

354
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,720
the irreversible expansion
we considered the system

355
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,880
isolated, Happened
spontaneously, and of course

356
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,430
you know that's the case.

357
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:37,570
Now, I'll just mention, and
later on we'll go into this in

358
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:40,310
considerably more detail, but
I'll just mention at this

359
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:45,130
stage through a little bit of
sort of foreshadowing that

360
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,040
everything we've discussed so
far about entropy is with a

361
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,720
macroscopic picture.

362
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,010
We started with heat engines
and Carnot cycles and

363
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,690
macroscopic processes,
reversible and irreversible

364
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:58,790
processes and so on.

365
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:02,620
But there's a, and that's
certainly the way it was all

366
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,080
formulated originally.

367
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,960
Part of the power of
thermodynamics is that it

368
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:12,190
doesn't depend on a specific
microscopic model of matter.

369
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,220
That said though, we
have a pretty good

370
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,670
microscopic model of matter.

371
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,170
We know about atoms and
molecules, and in fact there

372
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:25,890
is an entirely microscopic
formulation of entropy that

373
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:31,310
has to do with disorder and
the number of available

374
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,920
states, microscopic states
available to a system.

375
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:42,050
So I'll just state what
we'll see in much more

376
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,010
detail later on.

377
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:56,940
Which is in microscopic terms,
it's going to turn out that

378
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:04,270
the entropy of a system can be
given by R over Avogadro's

379
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:21,160
number times the log of the
number of distinct microscopic

380
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,840
states that are available
to a system.

381
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:28,030
Right so in this isolated
system, when we double that

382
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,240
volume, each molecule suddenly
has twice as many states

383
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,430
available to it.

384
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,140
You could formulate that
in a lot of ways.

385
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,350
You can sort of divide up the
volume into tiny little

386
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,240
molecule-sized cubes and realize
well, now, there are

387
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,730
twice as many of them.

388
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:52,950
Now if I have one molecule, the
number of states doubles.

389
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:56,080
If I have n molecules, the
number of states goes

390
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,540
up by 2 to the n.

391
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,690
Because for each one of the
molecules, I can select any

392
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,150
one of those states, and
then the next one I

393
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,110
can select any one.

394
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,570
So you have this enormous
increase in

395
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,370
the number of states.

396
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:19,740
So delta S in this case looks
like R over NA log of 2 to the

397
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,110
power NA, it's Avogadro's
number,

398
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:25,300
for a mole of molecules.

399
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,690
This can come out
and cancel this.

400
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,560
There's our R log 2 result.

401
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:37,210
But the point I'm making here
is that could actually be

402
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:42,800
derived from entirely
microscopic consideration.

403
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,580
We haven't gone through
that yet.

404
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,040
We've done entirely macroscopic
thermodynamics so

405
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:51,480
far, but we'll do a little bit
of treatment of statistical

406
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,000
mechanics, is what is called
the whole microscopic

407
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,620
formulation of entropy
in thermodynamics.

408
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,680
And that's a really important
fundamental result.

409
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:08,540
And we'll get to it in much
more detail in a while.

410
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,580
But for now, I just want to
continue calculating entropy

411
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:31,680
changes for a few more
kinds of processes.

412
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:37,940
So, how about if we have two
different substances and we

413
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:50,280
mix them, entropy of mixing.

414
00:32:50,280 --> 00:33:00,530
So, we start with some number
of moles of substance A in

415
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:05,480
some volume VA, and some other
number of moles of substance B

416
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:09,420
in volume VB, separated.

417
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,800
And then we remove the barrier,
of course we know

418
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:14,580
they're going to mix.

419
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,940
So we'll have some total number
of moles, nA plus nB,

420
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,650
and they'll be filling some
total volume, which is the sum

421
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,940
of the two original volumes.

422
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:28,750
Certainly this is what
we expect to happen

423
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,760
spontaneously.

424
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:41,370
So are process is nA moles of A,
gas, initial volume VA and

425
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:48,380
T, plus nB of substance B, I
think this is miswritten as A

426
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,980
there in your notes.

427
00:33:49,980 --> 00:34:01,780
Gas VB and T goes to nA moles of
A plus nB moles of B. Gas,

428
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:11,490
total volume and T. And
we'll have constant

429
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:15,310
temperature and pressure.

430
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,350
Well, there was no
p v worked done.

431
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:22,370
The temperature didn't change
and it's ideal gases, so delta

432
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:28,340
u is zero, but what
about delta S?

433
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,880
Well again, to calculate
it, we need to find

434
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,890
a reversible path.

435
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,200
This is irreversible if we just
remove the barrier and

436
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:37,080
let it all go.

437
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,620
But we could at least imagine
a reversible path, and we

438
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,730
could actually construct this
for the right substances.

439
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:53,560
We could imagine that we can
find some sort of piston here.

440
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,920
And we're going to prepare
to push it inward, with a

441
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,880
membrane that's permeable
only to b.

442
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,410
And over here we could set up
the exact same thing, but this

443
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:23,580
one's permeable only to a.

444
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:27,840
And then we could just push them
to recover this state.

445
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,470
And we can do it reversibly.

446
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,480
So we could construct a
reversible process that does

447
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,900
the reverse of this.

448
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,810
And in this case, it'll be
isothermal still, constant

449
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,950
pressure, reversible compression
of the two gases.

450
00:35:45,950 --> 00:36:22,580
So, reversible compression
and demixing.

451
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,980
All right, so what happens?

452
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:28,800
Well, of course, our delta S
of demixing is going to be

453
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,900
minus delta S of mixing.

454
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:40,800
Delta u of demixing
is still zero.

455
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,370
Temperature didn't change, ideal
gases, and there's some

456
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,000
reversible work and heat.

457
00:36:52,000 --> 00:37:04,730
So dw in this reversible case,
is just minus pA dVA minus pB

458
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:12,940
dVB, the infinitesimal amount
of work done as these things

459
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,380
are gradually moved
toward each other.

460
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:27,000
So delta S for demixing, of
course it's dq reversible over

461
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,960
T, but just like we did right
there, of course, in this case

462
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,070
that's just negative dw.

463
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:40,390
So it's integral from V to VA,
right, were compressing.

464
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,320
So for substance a, we're going
to go back to there.

465
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,620
It was occupying the whole
volume, and then it's going to

466
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,340
end up in only part
of the volume, VA.

467
00:37:48,340 --> 00:38:06,840
pA dVA over T. Same thing for
B, going to volume B, pB dVB

468
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,980
over T. And now we can
substitute for pressure,

469
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:22,360
right? pV is nRT, so it's nA
times R log of VA over V plus

470
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:33,580
nB of R log of VB over V.

471
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:37,720
Now, so this is a suitable
answer, but I'm going to make

472
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,020
if a little easier by putting
in terms of mole fractions.

473
00:38:42,020 --> 00:39:05,700
So, mole fractions, of course,
XA is nA over n, and XB is nB

474
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:13,750
over n and XA is also equal to
VA over V and XB is equal to

475
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:17,140
VB over V for ideal
gases, right?

476
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,940
The molar volumes
are the same.

477
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,600
We're at the same temperature
and pressure.

478
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:32,140
So that immediately gives us the
delta X of demixing is nR

479
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:42,660
times XA log XA plus
XB log XB.

480
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:47,030
And of course delta S of mixing
is the opposite of

481
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:58,930
this, minus nR XA log
XA plus XB log XB.

482
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,520
Now XA and XB are
mole fractions.

483
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:05,880
They are between zero and
one, So their log

484
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,590
rhythms are both negative.

485
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,160
There's a negative sign.

486
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,660
So delta S of mixing
is positive.

487
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,070
That's reassuring.

488
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:18,530
That tells us as we expect that
the mixing should happen

489
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:28,130
spontaneously and irreversibly
when we remove the barrier.

490
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,130
Any questions so far about how
we're going about these

491
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:34,640
calculations of delta S?

492
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:52,740
OK, let's just do a couple
more examples.

493
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,900
Here's a really straightforward
one.

494
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,270
What if we just heat stuff
up or cool it down.

495
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,430
It happens all the time, but
it's pretty important, right?

496
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:12,320
So let's just heat or cool
at constant volume.

497
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:17,120
So, we're going to go from
substance A at T1 and some

498
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:22,280
volume going to substance
A at T2 at some volume.

499
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,940
We can do this.

500
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:35,520
Delta S is integral of dq
reversible over T. Going from

501
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:43,400
T1 to T2, but we know how
to do this, right?

502
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,890
It's the heat that we need.

503
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:47,710
It's just given by the constant
volume heat capacity

504
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:49,320
times the change
in temperature.

505
00:41:49,320 --> 00:42:04,230
So this is just T1 to T2, Cv dT
over T. And that is just Cv

506
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:16,990
times the log of T2 over T1 if
Cv is temperature independent.

507
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,720
That's not always the case.

508
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,770
Usually if it's not too big an
excursion of temperature then

509
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,950
it's a reasonable
approximation.

510
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:33,080
So that's straightforward.

511
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:43,560
By the way, notice that delta
S is greater than zero if T2

512
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,780
is greater than T1.

513
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:45,080
1

514
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:50,060
In other words, if we heated
it up, delta S is positive.

515
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:55,040
Notice also delta S is
less than zero if T2

516
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,880
is less than T1.

517
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,860
Delta S is negative
if we cooled it.

518
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:06,520
Now, under certain conditions
we've seen that delta S can't

519
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,950
be negative.

520
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,930
Why can it be negative here?

521
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:14,530
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE].

522
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,250
PROFESSOR NELSON:
Yes, I heard it.

523
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,810
It's because the system
isn't isolated, right.

524
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,290
It was for the isolated system
that delta S is always greater

525
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,590
than or equal to zero.

526
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:27,020
And you know, for the whole
universe entropy never

527
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,210
decreases and so on.

528
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:32,980
In this case, though, you know
we're taking a system and

529
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,510
we're putting it in contact
with a cold bath

530
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:36,380
and cooling it down.

531
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,150
It's certainly not isolated.

532
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,830
Heat is being exchanged.

533
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:43,880
It's going from the system to
the surroundings, to the bath.

534
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:44,570
So it's fine.

535
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,080
Delta S can be negative.

536
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:53,110
What would happen if we
calculated delta S of a new

537
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:55,860
entire system consisting
of the original system

538
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,810
plus the heat bath?

539
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:00,120
What would delta S be then?

540
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:07,790
We already kind of did that with
those two blocks, T1 and

541
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:11,030
T2 in an isolated systems.

542
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:13,570
What do you think is
going to happen?

543
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,690
In other words, if we call our
system the stuff that is put

544
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:21,010
in contact with the heat bath,
well OK, then we've seen delta

545
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,570
S can be plus, can be positive
or negative.

546
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:28,200
Now let's call our system the
original system plus the heat

547
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,160
bath, and we'll put them all in
some isolating box, that's

548
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,080
thermally isolating and so on.

549
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:37,020
And now we'll put our original
system, which is now sort of a

550
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,590
sub, part of the system, and
it's now going to be in

551
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,450
contact with the cold bath.

552
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,440
The bath that it's in contact
with is colder than it is.

553
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,920
That's why its delta S
is less than zero.

554
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,950
But what's delta S to be for
the entire new system

555
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:58,350
including the cold bath?

556
00:44:58,350 --> 00:44:59,740
STUDENT: Wouldn't it
greater than zero?

557
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,540
PROFESSOR NELSON: Yes, it's
going to be positive, because

558
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:04,000
it's an isolated system
and something happened

559
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,040
spontaneously in it, namely the
original system got cooler

560
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:11,250
and presumably the heat
bath got at least

561
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:12,900
a little bit warmer.

562
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:15,370
And it happened spontaneously,
which immediately means delta

563
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:20,660
S had to be positive for that
entire assembly, of you know

564
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:25,160
the original system
plus the bath.

565
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:32,580
Here's another important
sort of process.

566
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:44,110
Reversible phase change, we'll
melt something or freeze it.

567
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:50,190
How about water -- liquid
100 degrees Celsius

568
00:45:50,190 --> 00:45:54,270
one bar goes to water.

569
00:45:54,270 --> 00:46:01,500
Gas 100 degrees Celsius
one bar.

570
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,510
Well in that case, you know
what the heat is.

571
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:11,750
It's just the delta H of
vaporization, right, at

572
00:46:11,750 --> 00:46:15,060
constant pressure.

573
00:46:15,060 --> 00:46:17,550
So there's nothing really
much to calculate here.

574
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:27,480
Delta S of vaporization for H2O
at 100 degrees Celsius is

575
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:36,080
just q of vaporization over the
boiling temperature, which

576
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:43,820
is delta H of vaporization over
the boiling temperature.

577
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,800
So that was easy.

578
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,320
One last thing.

579
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,130
What if we want to calculate the
entropy of melting or some

580
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:56,870
phase transition not
at equilibrium?

581
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:59,920
In this case it's at equilibrium
because it's water

582
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,190
and water vapor at 100 degrees
Celsius and one

583
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,870
atmosphere or one bar.

584
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,710
So it's at its boiling point.

585
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:14,690
But what if it isn't at
its boiling point?

586
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:24,570
So what if instead, let's take
H2O, liquid, at minus ten

587
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:29,580
degrees Celsius and one
bar so it's cold.

588
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,300
It's going to freeze.

589
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:35,620
So it's going to turn into
solid water at minus 10

590
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,540
degrees Celsius and one bar,
we're going to have it be

591
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:40,930
isothermal.

592
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:44,320
Now you know that's going to
happen spontaneously, and it's

593
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:52,730
irreversible.

594
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:56,320
Irreversible, which means we
can't just straight away

595
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:59,520
calculate delta S along
this path because it's

596
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,760
irreversible.

597
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,100
But what we can do, just like
we've done before for making

598
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:07,610
cycles, we can make some other
set of events that are all

599
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,240
reversible.

600
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,410
We can construct a reversible
pass that will get there.

601
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:13,560
How do we do it?

602
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:17,020
Well you know for the phase
change, for the freezing to be

603
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,890
reversible, it has to happen at
zero degrees Celsius right.

604
00:48:20,890 --> 00:48:23,030
You know that's where
you have reversible,

605
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:25,230
freezing and melting.

606
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:28,750
Reversible equilibrium between
liquid and solid water.

607
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:33,160
So surely that's got to
get involved here.

608
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,520
H2O liquid zero degrees
Celsius, one bar, in

609
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:44,550
equilibrium with H2O solid at
zero degrees Celsius, one bar.

610
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,590
Whatever reversible path we
construct that's going to go

611
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:52,640
from liquid to solid water,
somewhere along the set of

612
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,570
steps, that better
be one of them.

613
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,500
So now what we need to do is
go from liquid at minus 10

614
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,850
degrees Celsius and one bar to
liquid at zero degrees Celsius

615
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:05,520
and one bar.

616
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,140
That's called heating.

617
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,770
We have to heat it.

618
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:15,240
And here we have to cool it.

619
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,170
And we've already seen all these
three processes, right.

620
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:23,890
So for the phase change,
it's reversible now.

621
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:26,790
This is just delta
heat of fusion.

622
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,130
Great.

623
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:33,490
Because this is now
reversible.

624
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,010
This is going to
be reversible.

625
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:37,400
This is going to be reversible.

626
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,320
Great.

627
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,630
So dq reversible, it's going
to be the heat capacity at

628
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:46,350
constant pressure, the example
we did before it was constant

629
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:51,380
volume for the liquid dT.

630
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:59,650
Here, dq reversible is going
to be Cp solid, dT.

631
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,180
Those won't be the same right?

632
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,600
It's one thing to say the heat
capacity of something doesn't

633
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,170
change over some small excursion
in temperature, but

634
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,520
it's another thing when the
thing actually changes phase.

635
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:11,350
The heat capacity of the
solid and the liquid

636
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:14,690
won't be the same.

637
00:50:14,690 --> 00:50:18,020
So this we can just finish up in
a jiffy, because we're just

638
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:23,310
going to add the three things.

639
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:30,720
So delta S is delta S of
heating, minus, I think

640
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,960
there's a plus that should be
a minus there, minus delta S

641
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,150
of fusion because it's going in
the direction of freezing

642
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,070
the way we've written it.

643
00:50:38,070 --> 00:50:42,730
Plus delta S of cooling.

644
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:52,770
So integral from T1 to the
melting point of Cp of the

645
00:50:52,770 --> 00:51:01,930
liquid dT over T, minus delta
H of fusion over the melting

646
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:03,720
temperature.

647
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,750
Plus the integral going from the
heat of the temperature of

648
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:15,100
melting to T1 of Cp of
the solid dT over T.

649
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:18,770
That's it, all right?

650
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:24,870
So delta S is minus delta H of
fusion over T. That's what it

651
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:27,300
would be for just the reversible
phase change

652
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:30,190
happening at zero
degrees Celsius.

653
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:34,227
And then there's this additional
part which is, we

654
00:51:34,227 --> 00:51:39,370
can write it from T1 to melting
point of Cp of the

655
00:51:39,370 --> 00:51:47,140
liquid, minus Cp of the
solid, dT over T.

656
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,320
Now usually we can assume that
these will be temperature

657
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,080
independent in their
own phases.

658
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,950
So we can usually write this
as minus delta H of fusion

659
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:10,080
over the melting temperature
plus Cp of the liquid minus Cp

660
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:21,970
of the solid log of T
of fusion over T1.

661
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,580
Any questions?

662
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,900
What did we do?

663
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,785
We constructed a reversible path
going from here to here

664
00:52:28,785 --> 00:52:31,380
and calculated delta S that way,
and of course that has to

665
00:52:31,380 --> 00:52:36,110
be the same as delta S in the
one irreversible step.

666
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,360
All right, more on entropy and
its consequences for how to

667
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,930
figure out what happened
spontaneously next time.
