8
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,280
PROFESSOR: So last
time you learned

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:30,570
about the ideal solution limits
with Henry's law and Raoult's

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,620
law.

11
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:40,110
And I just want to start
with one reminder of what

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,310
this is all about.

13
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:50,440
So let's say that you have a
mixture of CS2 and acetone.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:56,680
So this is a review of
what you saw last time.

15
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,100
Acetone like this, CH3, CH3.

16
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:15,770
And if you take the CS2 as
the solvent and the acetone

17
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:27,450
as a solute, then when you plot
as a function of the amount

18
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,730
of CS2 here as a
solvent, then you

19
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:36,800
have the limit where the mole
fraction of CS2 goes to one,

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,610
meaning that CS is the solvent.

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,700
You expect Raoult to work
if it's an ideal solution.

22
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,720
So that the vapor
pressure of CS2

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:56,690
is related to the mole
fraction of CS2 times the vapor

24
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,460
pressure of CS2 if it was pure.

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,520
So you're sitting
here somewhere.

26
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,490
This is the vapor
pressure of CS2 pure

27
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,060
and CS2 goes from zero to one.

28
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,650
And you expect Raoult to work.

29
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:18,740
So let's do Raoult.

30
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:24,780
Like this.

31
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,180
So in this area, if I were
to plot the real curve,

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,070
I would expect it to start
out just like Raoult.

33
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,160
And then there's going
to be some deviation.

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,370
Then if I take the other limit,
where the mole fraction of CS2

35
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,030
goes to zero.

36
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,420
So now the CS2 is the solute.

37
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,720
And the acetone is
the solvent. what

38
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,700
happens for this
particular mixture is

39
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:58,230
that Henry's law
is no longer valid.

40
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:01,860
Raoult's law is not valid here.

41
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,890
Instead, you have to
look at Henry's law.

42
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,590
And Henry's law tells you
that for the solute now,

43
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,160
not the solvent,
so the CS2 here is

44
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,960
the solute, very
small amount of it.

45
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,090
Very small mole fraction.

46
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,910
That the vapor
pressure of the solute

47
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:21,970
is related to the mole
fraction in the solution.

48
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,280
But instead of having the vapor
pressure of the pure solute,

49
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
you have another number.

50
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,170
Another constant.

51
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,790
Which we call K. Which is
a Henry's law constant.

52
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,460
And this constant depends on
what else in the solution.

53
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:45,190
It depends on the fact that
you have acetone in there.

54
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,140
You would have a
different constant

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:51,620
if the acetone were replaced
with chloroform, let's say.

56
00:03:51,620 --> 00:04:00,940
So this constant here
cares what the solvent is.

57
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,080
And it cares what the
temperature is, also.

58
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,250
There's a lot of stuff that's
built into this constant here.

59
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,490
It's a phinemelogical constant.

60
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,800
And in the case of the
mixture of CS2 and acetone,

61
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,430
the deviation from
Raoult's law is positive.

62
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,290
Meaning that the
Henry's law constant

63
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:28,910
is greater than the vapor
pressure of the pure CS2.

64
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,310
So that means that
the molecules of CS2

65
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,590
would rather go
in the gas phase.

66
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,800
If there's acetone around.

67
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,210
That means they don't
like to mix so much.

68
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,050
They're not happy
with each other.

69
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,140
So the CS2 molecules
would rather

70
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,820
escape what would normally be
a Raoult's law type of solution

71
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,440
to go in the gas phase away
from being close to the acetone.

72
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,440
And as a result you get
this positive deviation.

73
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,450
You get a higher pressure than
you expect from Raoult's law.

74
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:13,350
So that the slope here
This slope here is K CS2.

75
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:18,820
And that slope
here is p star CS2.

76
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,520
This is a positive deviation.

77
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:28,100
And you saw an example where
you if you mix chloroform

78
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:36,880
and acetone, you get
a negative deviation.

79
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,010
Chloroform and acetone
are happy together

80
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:44,280
because of the hydrogen
bonding between the oxygen here

81
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,420
and the hydrogen in chloroform.

82
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,610
And you get a
negative deviation.

83
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:56,090
So let's start by doing
an example with numbers.

84
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:00,810
Of how this might come about.

85
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,410
Any questions on this first?

86
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:08,180
I always got confused with
Henry's law and Raoult's law.

87
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,385
And I always got
confused as to when

88
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:11,760
I was supposed to
use Henry's law

89
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,320
and when I was supposed
to use Raoult's law.

90
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,610
Very confusing to me, initially.

91
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,410
The thing to remember
is that if you're

92
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:24,630
talking about something which
in a very small amount, just

93
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:29,995
the solute, like, well I'm going
to give you an example which

94
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,620
is a bad example,
like sugar and water.

95
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,036
Where sugar is
clearly the solute,

96
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:36,990
but sugar is not volatile
clearly this is a bad example.

97
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,850
But something which in a very
small concentration, then

98
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,830
Henry's law is going to apply.

99
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,500
Raoult's law is only going
to apply for the solvent.

100
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,710
When you have a lot
of stuff around.

101
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,930
On this side here
is Raoult's law.

102
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,500
On this side here
is Henry's law.

103
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,530
Henry's law, the deviation's
from Raoult's law,

104
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,210
are going to happen where
the molecules in the solution

105
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:07,696
mostly see molecules that
are not like themselves.

106
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,570
If they mostly see
molecules like themselves,

107
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,310
since it's an ideal
solution, then they

108
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:14,940
don't know that there's
other stuff around.

109
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,360
In this case here, the CS2
molecules don't really know.

110
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,950
Most of them don't know that
there's any acetone around.

111
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,450
They couldn't care less.

112
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,060
So it obeys an ideal solution.

113
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,610
Here, they don't see
any other CS2 molecules.

114
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,190
They mostly see acetone.

115
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,859
And so Raoult's law is
going to fall apart.

116
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,400
Because Raoult's
law assumed that you

117
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,720
have a single component.

118
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,440
Or mostly one component.

119
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:41,940
OK.

120
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:45,990
Let's do an example.

121
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:49,176
So in this case
here, we're going

122
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:52,100
to work the example out here.

123
00:07:52,100 --> 00:08:03,390
So let's take two
components, A and B. Where

124
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:07,670
B is, and let's look
at something which

125
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:14,970
is a dilute solution
and non-ideal.

126
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:18,620
So there's going to be some
deviation from Raoult's law.

127
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,800
And what we're told
is at 50 degrees

128
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:32,050
Celsius, that the vapor pressure
of pure A is equal to 0.67 bar.

129
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:41,880
And the vapor pressure of
pure B is equal to 1.2 bar.

130
00:08:41,880 --> 00:09:02,250
So B is clearly
the more volatile.

131
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,660
And we're also told,
then, that at 50 degrees

132
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:17,350
C we have a molar fraction of
A in the liquid phase is 0.9.

133
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:22,620
And the molar fraction of B
in the liquid phase is 0.1.

134
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:30,860
And the total pressure above
the solution is 0.7 bar.

135
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,100
And eventually what we're
going to try to find out is,

136
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,580
we're going to change
these concentrations.

137
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,680
Are we going to
try to figure out

138
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,930
how the total pressure
above the solution changes.

139
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:48,420
That's maybe the
goal of the problem.

140
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:51,205
When you change this
to, eventually we'll

141
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:54,940
change it to 0.95
and 0.05, and we'll

142
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,020
want to know how does that
change the total pressure.

143
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,860
So immediately we see
that this is a solvent.

144
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,700
This is a solute.

145
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:09,670
This is volatile.

146
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,170
So, we're close to
where this is zero.

147
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,850
So if we're going to apply any,
sort of, Raoult or Henry's law

148
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,810
problem to this,
this is probably

149
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,860
going to be Henry's law for
B and Raoult's law for A.

150
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,080
We're going to be close
to this area here for B.

151
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,360
We're going to be close
to this area for A.

152
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:32,960
OK.

153
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,430
So ah the first
question is, what's

154
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:45,840
the composition
in the gas phase.

155
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:53,020
What is y sub B. And it looks
like this particular set

156
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:59,060
of notes doesn't have
the calculations.

157
00:10:59,060 --> 00:12:01,230
I'm going to go to my other set
of notes here that has them.

158
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,610
So, because I'm going
to make a mistake if I

159
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,390
go through it
without my notes, I'm

160
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:09,650
going to leave it up
to you to do part a.

161
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,427
That's a good way
out of making a mess.

162
00:12:11,427 --> 00:12:13,010
I'm just going to
tell you the answer.

163
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,520
Because the actual,
the interesting part,

164
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,740
is part b of the problem.

165
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,260
Part a is the easy part.

166
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,920
So this is something that
you can do on your own.

167
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,310
So yB is equal to 0.139.

168
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,420
Is going to be answer to
part b, given these two molar

169
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,400
fractions and the
total pressure.

170
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,010
So now, what we're
going to do is,

171
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,680
we're going to change
the molar fractions

172
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,470
and we're going to
find out how that

173
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:44,980
changes the total pressure.

174
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:51,310
So, second part is we're
still at 50 degrees Celsius.

175
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,970
And we're going to change the
molar fraction of A to 0.95.

176
00:12:55,970 --> 00:13:02,210
And the molar
fraction of B to 0.05.

177
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:09,270
And we're going to ask,
what is p total now.

178
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,110
So we write what we know.

179
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,742
Which is that we
expect p total to be

180
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:21,590
the sum of the partial pressures
of A and B. A is the solvent,

181
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:24,050
B is the solute.

182
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,160
It's a dilute
non-ideal solution. pA

183
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,002
is going to be proportional
to Raoult's law,

184
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:31,960
because it's a solvent.

185
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,600
It's in large quantities.

186
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,870
So it's going to be xA pA star.

187
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,800
And xB is going, and
pB is going to be

188
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,240
proportional to the
mole fraction again.

189
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,370
But because it's a solute, it's
seen most the other molecules

190
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,200
of A around, it's
not necessarily

191
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,030
going to be obeying
Raoult's law.

192
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:56,045
It's going to obey Henry's law.

193
00:13:56,045 --> 00:13:57,972
It's going to be close
to the zero point.

194
00:13:57,972 --> 00:14:00,430
There's going to be a deviation
because of the interactions

195
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,950
between A and B.
Which dominate now.

196
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:06,220
So instead of pA
star, we have KB here,

197
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,920
where this is the
Henry's law constant.

198
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,064
Which depends on the
fact that A is around.

199
00:14:11,064 --> 00:14:13,480
We get a different constant
if we have a different solvent

200
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,350
around.

201
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:19,500
So we know this.

202
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,780
We know this because that was
given to us at the beginning.

203
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,020
But we don't know this here.

204
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,670
We don't know what the
Henry's law constant here is.

205
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,160
But we can get it.

206
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,050
We can get it from part a here.

207
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,850
Because we have all the
information we need there.

208
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:42,380
So from part a, we
already have a mixture

209
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,810
where we're given
the total pressure.

210
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:53,840
So from part a,
KB is pB over xB.

211
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,990
And we calculated
what yB is over there.

212
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,680
On part a.

213
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,130
So we know what the
partial pressure of B is.

214
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,500
It's the molar fraction
of B in the gas

215
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,040
phase times the total pressure.

216
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:18,270
That's Dalton's law.

217
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:21,780
Then we divide by xB.

218
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:25,840
And then we plug in
the number 0.139 times

219
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,990
the total pressure
up there is 0.7.

220
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,780
Divided by 0.1.

221
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:40,350
And we get that
this is 0.973 bar.

222
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:49,410
So now we can plug this
in to our equation here.

223
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:55,450
We know xA, we know xB, we know
Raoult's law, the 0.67 pA star.

224
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,240
We know KB here.

225
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,240
We plug in all the
numbers, and we

226
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,890
get that the total
pressure is now 0.685 bar.

227
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:07,900
This is a pretty typical
example of a problem that

228
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,510
combines Raoult's law, Henry's
law and Dalton's law together.

229
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,630
And keeping track of these laws
takes a little bit of thinking.

230
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,400
And it's very, very common
on problem sets or exams

231
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,110
to mix these up.

232
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:29,360
So it's good to go
through examples like this

233
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,247
and really keep track of
where each law applies.

234
00:16:34,247 --> 00:16:35,830
Dalton's law applies
in the gas phase.

235
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:39,180
It's partial pressure
in the gas phase.

236
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:40,850
Henry's law is the pressure.

237
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:44,670
If you know what's happening in
the liquid phase, for a solute.

238
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,080
Raoult's law is the partial
pressure in the gas phase,

239
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,160
if you know what's happening
in the liquid phase.

240
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,910
So Raoult and Henry tell you
something about the pressure

241
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:54,040
if you know the liquid.

242
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,950
Dalton only deals with what's
happening in the gas phase.

243
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:06,640
OK, any questions
on the problem?

244
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,140
Alright.

245
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,870
So we did this problem
here, and now let's

246
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:16,810
draw the phase diagram for our
solute here, or for B, rather.

247
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:18,860
Zero to one.

248
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,110
And let's take a vote here.

249
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:31,160
So if Raoult's law worked for
B, for the mixture of A and B,

250
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,360
then we would have pB star here.

251
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,760
And everything would be great.

252
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,220
But Raoult's law doesn't work.

253
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,360
Close to molar fraction of zero.

254
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,580
Instead, Henry's law.

255
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,750
There's a deviation,
due to the interactions

256
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,760
between the molecules
A and B here.

257
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,070
So we have two choices
for the deviation.

258
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,230
We can have a
positive deviation,

259
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,670
or we could have a
negative deviation.

260
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:02,150
Positive deviation,
if the molecules of B

261
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,070
would rather be
in the gas phase,

262
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,570
than be in the mixture
in the liquid phase.

263
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:09,540
Meaning they don't
like molecules of A.

264
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,460
They don't like to be
mixed with molecules

265
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:23,090
of A. The energy of
interaction is not favorable.

266
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:25,970
The enthalpy is not
favorable, for mixing

267
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,245
A and B. In this case
here, the enthalpy

268
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:32,920
is favorable for mixing A and B.

269
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,100
So in this problem here,
which do you think it is?

270
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,650
The blue one or the green one.

271
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:40,900
Let's raise hands here.

272
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,070
How many people think
it's the blue one here.

273
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:47,770
Anybody else?

274
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,270
The right answer,
we have four people.

275
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:57,680
How many people think
it's the green one?

276
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,640
Four.

277
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,140
Five.

278
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,120
Six.

279
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,290
You didn't vote twice, did you?

280
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:08,110
Vote early, vote often, right?

281
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,570
Mayor Daley, the old
Mayor Daley in Chicago.

282
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:15,350
And if you know somebody
who's dead, vote for them.

283
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:18,370
OK, so this is the, I've
got about five people here.

284
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,640
And a bunch of
people didn't vote.

285
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,190
So it's a tie.

286
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,751
It's basically a tie here.

287
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,250
I think you should
think about this.

288
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,833
Maybe talk to each
other a little bit.

289
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:36,470
See if you can figure
out, given all the numbers

290
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,430
that are in this
problem here, you

291
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:46,240
know what, the pure
pressure on the solvent is.

292
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,530
We change concentrations here.

293
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:53,240
Got Henry's law constant out.

294
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,615
And Henry's law
constant is going

295
00:19:54,615 --> 00:19:56,906
to tell you whether or not
that enthalpy of interaction

296
00:19:56,906 --> 00:20:02,636
is favorable or not favorable.

297
00:20:02,636 --> 00:20:04,177
It's going to be a
positive deviation

298
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:34,760
or a negative deviation.

299
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,940
OK, shall we vote again.

300
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,420
How many people say
it's the blue one?

301
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,130
How many people say
it's the green one.

302
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,640
Thank you.

303
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,480
Alright.

304
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,100
Good.

305
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,600
Alright.

306
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,230
We have K sub B is
less than p star,

307
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:55,410
therefore it's a
negative deviation.

308
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,540
The pressure is less
than you'd expect.

309
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,040
The molecules like each
other better than you expect.

310
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,130
There is a favorable enthalpy
of interaction between A and B.

311
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,360
They like to interact.

312
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,940
It could be hydrogen bonding.

313
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:10,900
Could be a lot of
different things.

314
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,570
OK, so now if I put the
whole diagram together,

315
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,720
which I shouldn't
have erased here.

316
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,580
Right, so there's my
diagram here again.

317
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,360
There's Raoult's law.

318
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,660
There's the deviation
from Raoult's law here.

319
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:29,000
For one substance,
let's say for B. There's

320
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,010
Raoult's law for A. There's
a deviation for A. It

321
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,590
could be like this.

322
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,920
And if I now add
these two together,

323
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,380
instead of having
a diagram for, this

324
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:55,300
is a pressure xB, yB diagram,
pressure xB, yB diagram,

325
00:21:55,300 --> 00:22:00,490
instead of having Raoult's
law sitting right here.

326
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,990
And then the yB part down
here below, your usual sort

327
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:10,220
of ideal solution phase
diagram with the high pressure

328
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,940
of the liquid on top and
the gas on the bottom.

329
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:19,560
Now if you add the blue curve
and the red curve together,

330
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,340
you're not going to
get a straight line

331
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,600
like you did before.

332
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,220
When Raoult's law
applied throughout.

333
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,850
Instead you're going
to get a deviation

334
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,620
from the straight line.

335
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,140
You're going to
get a curve that's

336
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,000
always below the straight line.

337
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,390
Because we have the negative
deviation on both sides.

338
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,350
So you end up with
something that's

339
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,070
curved and deviates below.

340
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:45,930
And the same thing will
happen for the bubble line.

341
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,100
It will also deviate below.

342
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,230
In some way.

343
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,440
Maybe not as much, maybe.

344
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,030
So this is what you usually see.

345
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,280
You see deviation of
that whole phase diagram,

346
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,720
like you're pushing down on it.

347
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,300
Or maybe it didn't pulled up.

348
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,380
If you have a
positive deviation,

349
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,140
then it's the opposite.

350
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,720
It gets, this is
negative deviation.

351
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,820
And if you have a
positive deviation,

352
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,550
instead of having a
usual phase diagram,

353
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:21,270
you're going to get something
that's looking like this.

354
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,890
Which is the Henry's
law coming in.

355
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,390
Yes.

356
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,225
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

357
00:23:26,225 --> 00:23:26,850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

358
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,340
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

359
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:34,000
PROFESSOR: Doesn't matter.

360
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,340
Good question, though.

361
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:39,030
OK, so this is what
it usually looks like.

362
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,720
And everything
you've learned so far

363
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,190
can be applied to
these diagrams here.

364
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,460
There's one exception, though,
which is an important one.

365
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,430
Which is, sometimes,
these non-ideal diagrams

366
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,250
have a funny spot.

367
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,900
Which is that if I
draw them, so there's

368
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,850
my xB, yB, on the bottom.

369
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,150
Zero to one.

370
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,540
I have pressure here.

371
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:11,930
Sometimes, there's the dew line.

372
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,540
And the bubble line.

373
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,410
Sometimes, instead of
having a nice separation

374
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,380
between the bubble
and the dew line,

375
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,390
there's a special point
which for some reason

376
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:30,030
those two curves meet.

377
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,460
Non-ideality.

378
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,600
There's interaction
between the molecules.

379
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,140
In the gas phase and
the liquid phase.

380
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,750
This special point is
an interesting one.

381
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,880
Because, well, if I'm away
from this special point,

382
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,590
let's say I'm sitting to the
left of the special point,

383
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,680
right here.

384
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,180
And I can distill this thing.

385
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,860
I can take my gas phase here.

386
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:00,080
And increase the pressure.

387
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,220
Say I'm sitting here in
the mixture, gas phase

388
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:13,930
mixture with x prime B, y
prime B. Sorry, x prime B.

389
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,270
And I go up and I
increase the pressure.

390
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,960
Start making vapor.

391
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:27,524
Start making vapor, I
can find out what the,

392
00:25:27,524 --> 00:25:28,440
I start making liquid.

393
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,523
I can find out where the
composition in the liquid

394
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:34,920
is by going over to
the blue line here.

395
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,170
That tells me the
composition in the liquid.

396
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:41,454
And reading off the composition
of the liquid down here.

397
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:43,620
So this is actually the
composition in the gas phase

398
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:47,620
is yB prime. yB prime
is the gas phase.

399
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,150
I'm starting here.

400
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:52,190
I start to increase
the pressure.

401
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,880
I begin the
distillation process.

402
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,460
And I get a little
bit of liquid out.

403
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,330
And I can read off the
composition in the liquid. xB

404
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:00,840
prime.

405
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,150
And I know from this diagram
that xB prime is less then

406
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:08,250
yB prime.

407
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:12,460
So I'm enriching
my liquid in A. I'm

408
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,370
purifying my
solution in A, right?

409
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,690
I can get pure A out eventually.

410
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:20,820
The fact of doing
this, I can get pure A.

411
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,520
So I decrease the pressure,
I get the pure gas phase

412
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,650
of my new solution here.

413
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,157
And I increase the pressure.

414
00:26:27,157 --> 00:26:28,990
And go over and make a
little bit of liquid.

415
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,369
And capture that liquid.

416
00:26:30,369 --> 00:26:32,160
And repeat the process
over and over again.

417
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,490
And eventually I have pure A.

418
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:41,190
Now, suppose I'm sitting
here at this special point.

419
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:49,420
And I'm starting with yB And
let me call it a here. yB of a.

420
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,087
I'm sitting right here.

421
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:52,420
And I'm increasing the pressure.

422
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:56,630
I go all the way up here.

423
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,230
And I start making liquid. .

424
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,000
What's the composition
of liquid, compared

425
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,670
to the composition
of the gas phase?

426
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:05,460
What's y?

427
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:13,140
What's xB compared to yB
of this point up here?

428
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,420
It's the same.

429
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,530
So I'm making liquid.

430
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,600
I got the same composition.

431
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,150
Doesn't help me.

432
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,390
If I make a gas again, I still
have the same composition.

433
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,020
I can't distill.

434
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,860
I can't purify it.

435
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,350
So if I have this special
mixture here, of A and B,

436
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:46,442
at this point here, I form
what's called an azeotrope.

437
00:27:46,442 --> 00:27:47,900
And then you can't
separate it out.

438
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,690
You can't separate out
the mixtures into A and B.

439
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,860
You can't distill it
at that point here.

440
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,420
Now, you can draw the same
diagram in, instead of

441
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:05,610
pressure, mole fraction, you
can draw the same diagram

442
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:07,090
in terms of temperature.

443
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,560
And the same thing happens.

444
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:16,050
You can have
deviations from, this

445
00:28:16,050 --> 00:28:19,860
is the extra figures that
are on the bottom page

446
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,220
of the notes from
last time here.

447
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:24,630
That we've replaced here.

448
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:29,480
You can have a
positive deviation.

449
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,430
With a positive azeotrope.

450
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,660
And your T p
diagram, T x diagram.

451
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,720
Or you can have, depending
on the interactions

452
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,650
between the two
molecules, you can

453
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,100
have something that has
a negative deviation.

454
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,060
And a negative azeotrope here.

455
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:52,630
So in this case here, this is
a particularly awful situation.

456
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:56,940
Because there's your
liquid phase down here.

457
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,210
There's the gas phase here.

458
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,260
And now, suppose
that you're doing

459
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:06,660
some sort of distillation.

460
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:12,420
So you start here in the liquid
phase, with some composition.

461
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,791
You make a gas.

462
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:17,790
Let's say you're doing a
fractional distillation

463
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,850
of some sort.

464
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,610
Your gas now has a new mixture.

465
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:26,760
So this is the composition
in the gas phase.

466
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,920
You take that gas phase
mixture, and you condense it

467
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:31,670
in your condenser.

468
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:34,630
In your fractional
distillation condenser.

469
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:37,270
So now I've condensed it.

470
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:40,400
And I heat it up again.

471
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,990
I've condensed it.

472
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,300
So I'm here somewhere.

473
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:47,470
And cool it down so
that I have a liquid.

474
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,910
And I condense it.

475
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,890
And slowly I move over
to the azeotrope point.

476
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,990
And once I get there, I'm stuck.

477
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,410
And the same thing happens
if I'm on the other side.

478
00:29:57,410 --> 00:30:04,600
I'm on this point here, I
keep my solution, my mixture.

479
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:07,010
I make a gas, I read off the
composition of the gas phase

480
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:07,510
here.

481
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,180
I take my gas phase composition
out and I re-liquefy it.

482
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,900
So I'm here, down
here somewhere, again.

483
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,010
And I heat it up again.

484
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:18,570
And and I move to
the azeotrope point.

485
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,470
That's what happens if you have
a mixture of benzene and water,

486
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:25,240
for instance.

487
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,430
You can't distill it.

488
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,439
You work your way down
to this point here.

489
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,980
You can't use
fractional distillation

490
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,510
until you've separated it out.

491
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,520
So this is a real life problem.

492
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,250
And you have to do things
like change the pressure.

493
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,150
Do your distillation under
high pressure or low pressure.

494
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:46,340
To try to get this
point to separate out.

495
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,320
So you can get past this point.

496
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,860
Or to try to get the deviation
to become of the opposite sign.

497
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,940
Where you can start to
do some distillation.

498
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,330
Any questions on
azeotropes, before we

499
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:04,970
get to colligative properties?

500
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,990
If you're doing
organic chemistry,

501
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,590
and you're trying
to purify things,

502
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,660
this is a real pain, right?

503
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:11,710
Pain in the neck.

504
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:21,982
So you've got to know, which
things form azeotropes.

505
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,940
So we're going to start
colligative properties.

506
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,523
There are four
colligative properties,

507
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:28,570
and you already
know what they are.

508
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:32,970
And you've even seen
the math behind them.

509
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:35,540
And in fact, you've seen
the math for one of them

510
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:41,461
already pretty clearly.

511
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:42,960
And these colligative
properties are

512
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:50,650
properties that you use all the
time in your day to day life.

513
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,690
At least, three of them.

514
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:27,630
OK what are the four
colligative properties?

515
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:29,940
There is vapor
pressure lowering.

516
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,130
If you have a mixture and the
vapor pressure of the mixture

517
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:37,470
is less than the vapor
pressure of the pure material,

518
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:43,570
there's the boiling
point elevation.

519
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:50,270
If you add a large amount of
insoluble - not insoluble,

520
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:55,720
non-volatile solute to a
solution, you will depress,

521
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,220
you will increase the boiling
point of that solution like

522
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,184
the example of the salt
and water that I gave.

523
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,850
So if you need a lot
of salt to increase

524
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,030
the boiling point of water.

525
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:12,850
There's the freezing
point depression.

526
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,720
That's what we use to
melt ice in the winter.

527
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,410
By adding salt to it.

528
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:23,470
Then there's the
osmotic pressure.

529
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:28,880
Which is the example of the
freshwater fish in salt water,

530
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,790
or the saltwater
fish in fresh water.

531
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:35,310
Or the cells bursting
when you put them in.

532
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:41,040
OK, so these colligative
properties all come

533
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:45,590
from the fact if
I have a mixture,

534
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:51,650
the chemical potential of
a molecule in a mixture,

535
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,245
in the liquid
phase here, is less

536
00:33:55,245 --> 00:34:02,530
than the chemical
potential of the pure guy.

537
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:14,590
Where A is the solvent,
and B is some solute.

538
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:18,060
So this is always true if
your number of moles of A

539
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:21,620
is much larger than
number of moles of B. Mix

540
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,150
a little bit of B in there,
and the chemical potential of A

541
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,930
in the liquid is
going to come down.

542
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:28,350
Because of the mixing process.

543
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,910
Because of the
entropy of mixing.

544
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:36,520
And that's going to give
rise to these properties.

545
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,290
And, to do these, one more
thing before we start.

546
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:47,410
We're going to use a special
concentration for these guys.

547
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:50,480
We're going to use,
call something molality.

548
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,600
Molality.

549
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:58,310
Molality is the number
of moles of solute

550
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:07,050
divided by kilograms of solvent.

551
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,370
So it's moles per
weight of solvent.

552
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:13,870
As opposed to moles
per liter, which

553
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:16,420
is something that
we're more used to.

554
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,000
Moles per kilograms of solvent.

555
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,230
It's pretty close to
moles for liter for water.

556
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,890
Because a gram of water
is a milliliter, roughly.

557
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:28,320
The density of
water's close to one.

558
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,060
So let's start on these things.

559
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:41,130
So we've already seen this.

560
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:47,740
You've already seen
vapor pressure lowering.

561
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,690
It comes from Raoult's law.

562
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,620
If I look at the change in
the vapor pressure of A, pA

563
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:04,790
minus pA star. pA is equal to
xA pA star. xA pA star, that's

564
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:06,060
Raoult's law.

565
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,930
Minus pA star, that's
equal to one minus xA.

566
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:14,740
Minus pA star.

567
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,170
Which is minus xB pA star.

568
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:25,290
Which is less than zero.

569
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:31,070
So, that means that the vapor
pressure above the solution

570
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:33,000
is lowered.

571
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,290
So I should have said
vapor pressure lowering.

572
00:36:39,290 --> 00:36:41,760
And we also drew a
phase diagram to show

573
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,490
how this vapor
pressure lowering was

574
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,600
going to imply freezing point
depression and boiling point

575
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,340
depression.

576
00:36:53,340 --> 00:37:01,260
So now let's go on and look at
the freezing point depression.

577
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:01,760
Number two.

578
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,300
We're going to find that the
change in the boiling point

579
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,190
is going to be some constant
K sub b, which is not

580
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,140
to be confused with
Henry's law's constant.

581
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,790
It's completely different.

582
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:16,480
This is a colligative property.

583
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,490
Times the molality
of B. That's going

584
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,860
to be the answer
we're going to get.

585
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:26,020
Amount of temperature
change depends linearly

586
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,640
on the molality of
B, with a constant

587
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,990
that depends on
what the mixture is.

588
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,890
And what the pressure is.

589
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,860
Whenever we derive anything
connected to phase transitions,

590
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:39,610
we usually always
start with the fact

591
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,290
that the chemical
potential changes.

592
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,965
And it has to be
equal at equilibrium.

593
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,340
So that's what
we're going to do.

594
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:51,370
We're going to start with
the chemical potential equal

595
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,980
of the liquid phase is equal
to the chemical potential

596
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,500
of the gas phase.

597
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,790
For the solvent at equilibrium.

598
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:05,330
And the liquid phase
obeys Raoult's law.

599
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:08,810
So it's going to be the chemical
potential of the pure material.

600
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:10,770
The pure liquid.

601
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:15,040
Plus RT log xA.

602
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,440
So this is where the mixing
of the solute comes in.

603
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:24,480
And on the gas phase
side, mu A, it's

604
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:26,944
going to be the same thing
as the chemical potential

605
00:38:26,944 --> 00:38:28,360
of the pure A.
Because we're going

606
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:35,540
to take B to be non-volatile.

607
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,060
So the only thing
in the gas phase

608
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,760
is A. Same chemical
potential as if it were pure.

609
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,200
Because it is pure.

610
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:50,850
So now we solve for log xA
is equal to one over RT mu

611
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:58,810
A star in the gas phase minus
mu A star in the liquid phase.

612
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,480
And this is just the
Gibbs free energy

613
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,980
per mole of A in the gas phase.

614
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,520
The Gibbs free energy per
mole of A in the liquid phase.

615
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,470
So we can replace this with
the change in Gibbs free energy

616
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,840
from going from gas to liquid.

617
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,343
Per mole, which
is just the Gibbs

618
00:39:13,343 --> 00:39:15,270
free energy of vaporization.

619
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,460
We're going from liquid to gas.

620
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:23,410
And I probably have a
negative sign somewhere.

621
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,160
No this is right, this
is the final state.

622
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,400
This is the initial state.

623
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,030
Divided by RT.

624
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:33,275
OK.

625
00:39:33,275 --> 00:39:34,900
That's not really
what we want, though.

626
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,010
What we want is
delta T. Here I've

627
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,180
got some complicated
equation that has T in it,

628
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,920
but not delta T.
But before we do

629
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,930
that, before we transfer
and try to get a delta T out

630
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,930
of this equation,
let's see if we

631
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,650
can do any sort of
simplifications here.

632
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,040
I don't like to
carry logs around.

633
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,930
There are no logs around here.

634
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:03,230
So let's see if we can
get rid of that log.

635
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:08,780
What is log xA?

636
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,640
Log xA, well, xA
is close to one.

637
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,700
It's connected to xB.

638
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,640
And everything in
here is connected

639
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,030
to B. There's a
molality of B here.

640
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,060
The concentration of A
doesn't come into play here.

641
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,310
I don't want it there.

642
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:27,880
So let me replace it with B. one
minus xB. xB is a small number.

643
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,180
It's a solute, it's
in small amount.

644
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:34,020
We're close to being
a pure solvent here.

645
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,520
So one minus
something very small.

646
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,940
The log of that.

647
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,460
Well if you've worked
with Taylor's expansions.

648
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,320
You probably know that
that's close to minus xB.

649
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,330
The log of one minus
x where x goes to zero

650
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,820
is close to minus x.

651
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,050
So that's minus xB.

652
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,590
Now, minus xB, in
terms of the moles,

653
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:58,130
is the number of moles of B
divided by the number of moles

654
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,560
of B plus the number of moles
of A, the total number of moles.

655
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,660
The number of moles
of B is very small,

656
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:10,310
compared to the number of moles
of A. So I can get rid of this.

657
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,860
So, and there's a
minus sign here.

658
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:17,170
So this is approximately
minus nB divided by nA.

659
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,710
Now, the only I can do is, I'm
trying to get at molality here.

660
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:22,450
I said we're going
to use molality.

661
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,226
Got moles.

662
00:41:23,226 --> 00:41:24,850
I don't have kilograms
of solvent here.

663
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:25,990
I have moles of solvent.

664
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:27,840
I'm not so happy with that.

665
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,905
So, in order to get something
that has kilograms out,

666
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:37,170
let's multiply up and down by
capital M where capital M is

667
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:40,760
that total mass of A. Basically
the number of kilograms

668
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,680
of solvent.

669
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:50,840
Total mass of A. So
now, this fraction here,

670
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,880
that's the molality.

671
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,430
That's what I'm looking for.

672
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,850
So this is minus the molality.

673
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:03,330
Then I have the total
mass of A divided

674
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,010
by the number of moles
of A. Well, that's

675
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:09,296
the molecular weight of it.

676
00:42:09,296 --> 00:42:11,004
Total mass divided by
the number of moles

677
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:12,600
is the molecular weight.

678
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,370
So this is the molality of
B times the molecular weight

679
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:18,790
of A. OK.

680
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,820
So now I can plug this
instead of log xA.

681
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:29,930
And I get minus nB times
nA is equal to delta

682
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:38,830
G of vaporization divided by RT.

683
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:42,360
Let's rearrange a little bit.

684
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:46,690
And mB is equal to to delta
G vaporization divided

685
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:52,220
by nA times RT, with
a negative sign.

686
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,350
Well, I've eliminated
the log at least,

687
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,110
but I still don't have
a delta T in there.

688
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:58,590
I don't have a delta
T. How am I going

689
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,780
to get a delta T in there?

690
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,770
Got to get the delta T.
Everything's very small.

691
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:06,350
So one way to get a small
change in temperature

692
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,640
is to take a derivative
with respect to temperature.

693
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,970
That's going to get
a delta T in there.

694
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,140
So I'm going to take the
derivative of both sides

695
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,930
with respect to T.

696
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,550
And delta T is going
to come out that.

697
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:25,840
I'm going to take d nB
/ dT, constant pressure.

698
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:36,560
Minus one over mA times
R d delta G over T. This

699
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,170
is delta G of vaporization.
dT, constant pressure.

700
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:47,070
And I wish I'd made my
boards a little bit better.

701
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:51,720
Because I have to
cover things up.

702
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,470
OK, now I have this derivative
of the Gibbs free energy

703
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:56,590
divided by the temperature.

704
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,910
This turns out to be something
that you've seen before.

705
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:10,220
It's called the
Gibbs-Helmholtz equation.

706
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,940
And it relates the temperature
change in the Gibbs free energy

707
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,220
with the enthalpy change.

708
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:23,490
The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation
is that the d delta G over T dT

709
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,050
is equal to minus
delta H over T.

710
00:44:28,050 --> 00:44:31,720
And you can get that from just
writing fundamental equations

711
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,735
about G and H. And
turning the crank.

712
00:44:34,735 --> 00:44:36,710
And we've done that before.

713
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,250
And I'll leave that
as an exercise for you

714
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:41,460
to go back and figure
out what, you can go back

715
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,820
to your textbook and look
at, you know under the index.

716
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:49,000
Gibbs-Helmholtz, and figure
out why this is the case.

717
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,560
So now, we have
this equation here.

718
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,143
This is going to be
nice, because it's

719
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:53,890
going to get rid of the d/dT.

720
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,200
On the right-hand side.

721
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,960
And so now our
equation becomes d

722
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:09,360
mB / dT is equal to delta H
vaporization divided by mA R T

723
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:13,340
squared.

724
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,170
Now, I can rewrite this in
a slightly different way.

725
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,220
This is delta m over
delta T, basically.

726
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:22,446
Delta the change
in number of moles.

727
00:45:22,446 --> 00:45:23,820
I mean, the molality
of B divided

728
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:25,028
by the change in temperature.

729
00:45:25,028 --> 00:45:26,540
I'm getting very close here.

730
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,430
There's a change in
temperature here.

731
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:30,580
There's a change
in molality here.

732
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:33,400
I can rewrite this
as delta T, then,

733
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,380
is equal to molecular
weight of A times

734
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:46,530
RT squared divided by delta H
vaporization times delta mB.

735
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,610
Now, I'm making a very
small change in B here.

736
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,420
Starting at zero.

737
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:53,530
Basically I'm taking
pure A and I'm

738
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:56,890
dumping in a little
bit of B. That's

739
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:58,990
what I'm doing
when I experiment.

740
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:01,519
I'm dumping in a little
bit of B in my pure A,

741
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,060
and I'm trying to figure out
how the temperature is changing.

742
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,690
So I'm doing delta m sub
B is my small amount of B

743
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:10,470
that I'm adding to the solution.

744
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:13,160
Minus what I started out
with, which was zero.

745
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:18,114
So delta mB is basically
m sub B. Right?

746
00:46:18,114 --> 00:46:19,280
That's basically what it is.

747
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,630
So let's get rid
of this delta here.

748
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:22,930
What else can I say?

749
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,490
Well, I can say that the
temperature change that I'm

750
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,019
looking at is also pretty small.

751
00:46:27,019 --> 00:46:28,560
Compared to the
absolute temperature.

752
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,380
This is a small change.

753
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,350
I'm only adding a small
amount of B in there.

754
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:38,000
So this temperature up here is
not going to change very much.

755
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,530
Let's take it to
be the temperature

756
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:45,100
of the boiling point
of the pure material.

757
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:50,570
T sub B star, of
the pure material.

758
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:53,190
OK And there's my delta T here.

759
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,025
So this is of the
form delta T is

760
00:46:56,025 --> 00:47:03,290
equal to molecular weight
of A. Times R. Times

761
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:06,250
the boiling point of the
pure material squared.

762
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,250
Divided by delta
H of vaporization

763
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,750
of the pure solvent.

764
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:19,140
Times the molality of B. And
this combination of properties

765
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:23,360
of A, the molecular weight of
A, the boiling point of pure A.

766
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:32,300
The heat of vaporization of
pure A, this is K sub b up here.

767
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,670
Which I covered up.

768
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:44,700
It's of the form delta T is
equal to K sub b times mB.

769
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:50,580
And this turns out to be
always greater than zero.

770
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,530
Now.

771
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:54,720
If you want to look at
freezing point depression,

772
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,200
it's really easy.

773
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:07,830
In your equations, it's the
same thermodynamic picture.

774
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:10,730
All you need to do,
in all your equations,

775
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:15,590
you replace delta
G of vaporization

776
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:19,200
with minus delta G of freezing.

777
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,410
When we did a vaporization,
we're going from liquid to gas.

778
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:26,710
We had delta G of vaporization.

779
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:29,730
When we're doing freezing
point depression,

780
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:34,350
we're going from
liquid to solid.

781
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:40,450
And so we have to use
minus delta G of fusion.

782
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,674
Minus delta H of
fusion. s to l would

783
00:48:42,674 --> 00:48:44,090
be the positive
delta G of fusion.

784
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,150
So we're going from
liquid to solid.

785
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,900
We have to replace
delta G of vaporization

786
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,910
with delta G of fusion.

787
00:48:50,910 --> 00:48:53,810
We replace delta
H of vaporization,

788
00:48:53,810 --> 00:48:57,220
where minus delta H of fusion.

789
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,380
Replace the boiling point
with the freezing point.

790
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,980
And replace K sub
b with K sub f.

791
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,740
And the math is
exactly identical.

792
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,110
It all starts from the chemical
potentials being equal.

793
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:15,220
And turning the crank
at equilibrium, being

794
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,560
equal between the solid
phase and the liquid phase.

795
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:18,620
And turning the crank.

796
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,910
The solid phase is
like the gas phase.

797
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:24,680
It's a pure A, pretty much.

798
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,380
Because the molecules
of B are stuck.

799
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:30,769
And A doesn't know that B's
around, in the solid phase.

800
00:49:30,769 --> 00:49:32,810
They know that they're
around in the liquid phase

801
00:49:32,810 --> 00:49:35,500
because the fusion
fast enough. .

802
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,600
And then we can write,
if we turn the crank,

803
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,590
we get an equation
that looks like this.

804
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:43,990
The freezing point depression
is equal to minus mA

805
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:48,810
R Tf star squared.

806
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:53,670
Divided by delta H
of fusion, for mole.

807
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:56,240
Times the molality
of B. And this number

808
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,740
is always less than zero.

809
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:01,510
There's the negative
signs in here.

810
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:03,090
OK.

811
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:05,050
Always depressed.

812
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:09,840
Any questions about those
freezing point depression

813
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,840
and boiling point elevation.

814
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:14,820
Yes.

815
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:20,000
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] PROFESSOR:
Why did I drop it here?

816
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,850
Because the small change
that I'm making in nB

817
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:27,840
is going from pure
A, where nB is zero,

818
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,330
to a very small amount of nB.

819
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:34,550
That's why I'm
allowed to say this.

820
00:50:34,550 --> 00:50:38,230
And then just replace
delta nB with nB.

821
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,020
I'm comparing every,
my reference point

822
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:41,550
is the pure material.

823
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,850
I'm just adding a little
bit to start with.

824
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:45,910
It's a good question.

825
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,730
Any other questions?

826
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:51,300
OK.

827
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:53,670
I didn't get to
osmotic pressure.

828
00:50:53,670 --> 00:50:56,580
You'll get to that on Friday.

829
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:58,190
And also start
statistical mechanics.

830
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:03,090
And after osmotic pressure,
you'll be done with thermo.

831
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:05,800
It'll be statistical
mechanics and then kinetics.
