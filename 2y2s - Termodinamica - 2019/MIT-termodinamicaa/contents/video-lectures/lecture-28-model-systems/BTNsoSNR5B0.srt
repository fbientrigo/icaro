8
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,070
PROFESSOR: Last few lectures,
and we started to see some of

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,250
the consequences and looked
at simple changes,

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,460
transformations of expansion
and mixtures

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,020
of liquids and gases.

12
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:34,470
And saw how in the framework of
statistical mechanics, we

13
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,310
could derive the thermodynamic
results that you saw before,

14
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:39,820
based on an empirical
framework.

15
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,400
On the thermodynamic framework
we've been

16
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,740
working with all term.

17
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,940
But you saw them derived from
a microscopic perspective.

18
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,060
Now what I want to do is move
to examples that are more

19
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,000
commonly encountered
in chemistry.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,860
One that we did last time
actually was very common, or

21
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,070
is at least a prototype
for something common.

22
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,275
That is we looked at what would
be a simple model for a

23
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,980
polymer with different
configurations

24
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,310
available to it.

25
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,550
And just tried to understand
what the basic thermodynamics

26
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,240
is that it would exhibit.

27
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,590
What the heat capacities would
be in various limiting cases.

28
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,320
High and low temperature.

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,180
I want to continue that today.

30
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,090
But for an even more
common case.

31
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:23,480
So the model that I want to lay
out is indicated on your

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,540
notes for today.

33
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,440
And essentially, you
could look at it as

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,370
double stranded DNA.

35
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,850
Any kind of polymer with
a whole variety of

36
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,950
configurations.

37
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,150
Ultimately what's going to
matter is what is the set of

38
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,170
energy levels available
to the system.

39
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:44,480
And so here's what
it looks like.

40
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,700
The way I've tried
to depict it.

41
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm imagining something like,
covalently bonded chains that

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,690
have links between them.

43
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:03,250
So of course, it's reminiscent
of DNA with hydrogen bonding

44
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,770
between the strands.

45
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:09,910
And the idea in this simple
model is that you can have

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,110
various numbers of these
hydrogen bonds.

47
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,890
So this is the case that
would be the most

48
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,980
energetically stable.

49
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,010
That is, all the available
hydrogen bonds are formed

50
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,930
between neighboring pairs.

51
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:26,570
So this would be our
lowest energy.

52
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:29,890
Now let's starts breaking
some hydrogen bonds.

53
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:34,020
And what I'm imagining is they
break starting at one end and

54
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,110
working their way down.

55
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:52,370
So the next highest energy
state would be like this.

56
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,610
So now these are still
hydrogen bonded.

57
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,980
This is not.

58
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,040
And there's a cost in
energy for breaking

59
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,140
that hydrogen bond.

60
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,910
We'll call it epsilon zero.

61
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:06,340
It's a positive number.

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,100
So that this is higher
energy than this.

63
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:15,500
And now we'll go to the next
one, which could have two

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,440
broken bonds.

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:26,980
Broken hydrogen bonds.

66
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,580
And so on.

67
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,990
And if we imagine that this is
very long, there may be many

68
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,320
many, members of the chain.

69
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,030
Then of course this sequence
of structures with

70
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,360
corresponding energies might
go on for a very long way.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,500
So this is a simple construction
that gives us a

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,670
set of states with distinct
energies.

73
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:56,340
And so we have a series of
configurational energy levels.

74
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,990
They're evenly spaced
in this model.

75
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:09,780
So there's zero, E
zero, two E zero.

76
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,530
And so on.

77
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,630
So those are available
energy states.

78
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,920
And now, just based on that
simple model, we should be

79
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,570
able to figure out all
the thermodynamics.

80
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,620
We should should be able
to figure out what the

81
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:28,710
equilibrium energy is at a
particular temperature.

82
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,230
What the average energy is.

83
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,330
And so forth.

84
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:39,150
And we can do it in a
straightforward way.

85
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:47,440
So we'll start with our
molecular partition

86
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,230
function, as always.

87
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,920
So it's q configurational.

88
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,300
And it's just a sum over our
available states with their

89
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,240
associated Boltzmann factors.

90
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,170
So sum over n of e to the
minus En over kT.

91
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:10,110
Now the way I've modeled this,
there are no degeneracies.

92
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,660
Each energy level has just one
microscopic state of the

93
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,280
molecule corresponding to it.

94
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,240
So there are no molecular
degeneracies.

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,840
Turns out we'll be able to put
this into a simple form.

96
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,110
So the first thing is, let's
approximate that we could take

97
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:31,920
the sum -- not to some finite
level, which would be the case

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,900
if there's a finite number
of elements in the chain.

99
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:48,660
But all the way through
infinity.

100
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,560
And the idea here is
the following.

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
We'll assume that the
chain at least has

102
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,140
a great many members.

103
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,590
Even if it's finite.

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,140
And then at some point, this
becomes a really small number.

105
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,840
Even if epsilon naught, the
energy of one of the bonds, is

106
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,650
less than kT.

107
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,530
Once we multiply it by a very
large number n, it becomes

108
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,320
very much greater than kT.

109
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,200
So the underlying assumption
here is, well there will not

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,600
be a significant number of
molecules in the highest

111
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,790
energy state anyway.

112
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,150
In other words, the terms higher
than a finite but large

113
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,200
value of n between there and
infinity are going to be so

114
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,585
small that those terms will
contribute negligibly to the

115
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:40,990
sum anyway.

116
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:43,280
And on that basis, we could
make this approximation.

117
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,730
And the incentive to make this
approximation and carry the

118
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:48,860
sum to infinity is that then we
can put this in what turns

119
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:52,060
out to be a very simple
closed form.

120
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:56,280
So now if we just write out a
few of the individual terms in

121
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,450
the sum, it's one plus
e to the minus

122
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,330
epsilon zero over kT.

123
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:08,240
Plus e to the minus epsilon
zero over kT.

124
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,520
I'll write this as squared.
e to the minus two

125
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,670
epsilon zero over k t.

126
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,830
And so on.

127
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,330
So this has the form of a sum
that looks like one plus x,

128
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,970
plus x squared, and so on.

129
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,450
And because the sum goes to
infinity, we can simply write

130
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,630
it as one over one minus x.

131
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,590
Sort of a very simple result.

132
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,550
And now putting this back into
x, it's one over one minus e

133
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,290
to the minus epsilon
zero over kT.

134
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:45,450
That's our q zero.

135
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:51,140
Our molecular partition
function.

136
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,860
So this model yields a
particularly simple

137
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,740
result for q zero.

138
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:59,360
And then everything else
follows from there.

139
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:12,430
So then we can write the
canonical partition function

140
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,420
capital Qn.

141
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:21,100
It's just q configurational to
the capital Nth power, where

142
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,690
capital N is the total number
of these molecules.

143
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,640
So it's just one over one minus
e to the minus epsilon

144
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:35,930
over kT to the Nth power.

145
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,190
And then we can start writing
out the results for the

146
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,940
various thermodynamic
properties.

147
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:54,140
So A configurational is minus
NkT, log q configurational.

148
00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:03,150
That is, remember, A is minus kT
log capital Q. And this is

149
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,410
just going to come
straight out.

150
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,850
So it's minus NkT
log of little q.

151
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:17,240
Minus NkT, log of one over
one minus e to the minus

152
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,950
epsilon over kT.

153
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:26,880
Or positive NkT, log of one
minus e to the minus

154
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,140
epsilon over kT.

155
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,010
So a pretty simple form for
the Helmholtz free energy.

156
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,790
And I'm not going to write out
all of the individuals

157
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,510
thermodynamic terms, but I'll
write a few of them.

158
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:46,485
So mu, the chemical potential
for these configurations, is

159
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,735
just dA/dN.

160
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,190
With T and V constant.

161
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,030
And so the only capital
N dependence, the only

162
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,490
dependence on the number of
molecules is multiplicative.

163
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:03,320
Right here.

164
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,750
So this just gives us kT log
of one minus e to the minus

165
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,820
epsilon naught over kT.

166
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,980
And the important point to
realize here that we mentioned

167
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,830
last time too, in the examples
we considered then, especially

168
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,750
the last one, is that because
the only place that N figures

169
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:26,050
in is as a multiplicative
factor.

170
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,490
What this is telling us is that
we just have a chemical

171
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:33,180
potential, of Helmholtz free
energy per molecule.

172
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,910
The molecules are
all independent.

173
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,140
The total energy doesn't depend
on any interaction

174
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,530
between this molecule and its
neighbor somewhere else.

175
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:45,750
So terms like this are
simply additive.

176
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,420
So if we work out the chemical
potential, it's just one over

177
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:56,120
N times A.

178
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:04,410
And I'll just write the result
for u configurational.

179
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,040
Because I do want to look
at the heat capacity.

180
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:22,670
So it's Nk T squared, d log of
little q configurational / dT.

181
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,590
With N and V held constant.

182
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:31,310
And it turns out to just
be N epsilon zero.

183
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:40,770
One over E zero over
kT minus one.

184
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,930
So now we can look at
the heat capacity.

185
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,030
Cv configurational.

186
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:54,590
So it's du configurational
/ dT.

187
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,420
With constant N and V. And
taking this derivative with

188
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,600
respect to temperature.

189
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,160
Gives us an expression of
the following form.

190
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:16,920
It's Nk epsilon zero over k T
squared. e to the E zero over

191
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:24,460
kT, over e to the E zero over
kT minus one squared.

192
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,480
Just taking the derivative
in the usual way.

193
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,530
Now, this looks kind
of complicated

194
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,360
for the heat capacity.

195
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,330
But let's take a look, just like
we did last time for the

196
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,130
simpler case that we treated
then, let's take a look at the

197
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,800
high and low temperature limits
of what happens to the

198
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,010
heat capacity.

199
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:59,740
So at high temperature, well we
can start by just looking

200
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,100
at the energy.

201
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,570
That has a form that's
fairly simple.

202
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:07,790
So when temperature is large,
this is small, and we can

203
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,950
Taylor expand it.

204
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,130
So then we're just going to
have one plus epsilon zero

205
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,010
over kT minus one.

206
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,160
Which means the ones
will cancel.

207
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,450
And we end up with a fairly
simple result.

208
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:24,830
So u configurational, in
that case, is just NkT.

209
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:31,580
The epsilon zeroes are
going to cancel also.

210
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,200
And what that says is that the
heat capacity -- and of course

211
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,720
we could take the limit of this,
but we can just take the

212
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,090
derivative of this
with respect to

213
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,850
temperature more easily.

214
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:45,230
So Cv configurational.

215
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,340
It's just N times k.

216
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,450
In other words, the heat
capacity in the high

217
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:53,480
temperature limit
is a constant.

218
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,430
Last time we treated a simpler
case, where there were only

219
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:01,930
four configurations altogether
available, to this sort of

220
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,490
simple polymer model
that we drew.

221
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:08,330
Unlike this present model where
we're saying there are

222
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:12,510
essentially infinite number of
configurations and different

223
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,240
energies available.

224
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,420
So many that the highest ones
we're never even going to

225
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,420
access, because they'll be
much higher than kT.

226
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,760
Here it's different,
so now we have --

227
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,620
You know before, when we had
a limited number of total

228
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,980
states, remember what happened
in the heat capacity at high

229
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,420
temperature.

230
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,910
What was the limiting case?

231
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,920
Finite number of states.

232
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,710
What's the heat capacity
at high temperature?

233
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:45,180
This is going to
be on the exam.

234
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,750
What's the heat capacity at high
temperature, if there's a

235
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,540
finite number of states
available?

236
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,660
STUDENT: Zero.

237
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,310
PROFESSOR: It's zero.

238
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:57,550
What was the low temperature
limit of the heat capacity?

239
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,670
STUDENT: Zero.

240
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,700
PROFESSOR: It was also zero.

241
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,180
Right.

242
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:05,980
And the idea was for
a system with a

243
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,510
finite number of states.

244
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,010
The idea was -- so let's say,
the way we had it before,

245
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,970
there was one state
with energy zero.

246
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,290
And we had three states with
some energy epsilon zero.

247
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,840
And that was it.

248
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,500
Those were all the molecular
states available.

249
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,960
So we looked at the two cases.

250
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:31,130
In one case, when the high
temperature limit where kT is

251
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,640
much bigger than any
of this stuff.

252
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,990
In that limit, the molecules are
just equally likely to be

253
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,560
in any of these states.

254
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,260
Because there's much, much more
thermal energy than this

255
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,130
energy difference.

256
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,860
And the molecules are constantly
getting kicked

257
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,960
around by the available
thermal energy.

258
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,940
So if you raise the temperature
a little bit more,

259
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,320
it doesn't make any
difference.

260
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,800
The molecules already
are evenly

261
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,260
distributed among the states.

262
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,080
There's no additional
configurational energy.

263
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,480
So du/dT is zero.

264
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,640
It can't increase any more.

265
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,090
So in that case, the high
temperature limiting heat

266
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,950
capacity is zero.

267
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:19,240
And in the other case --

268
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,640
In the low temperature
limit, now let's say

269
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
kT is really low.

270
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,700
It's much less than
epsilon zero.

271
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,900
So now we'll redraw
this as zero.

272
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:36,940
And put the epsilon zero
states up here.

273
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,740
And kT is here.

274
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,710
Well when it's like this, the
temperature is so low that

275
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:46,240
there's not nearly enough
thermal energy to populate any

276
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,420
of these states.

277
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,320
And if you change the
temperature by a little bit,

278
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,700
it's still not enough thermal
energy to populate any of

279
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,740
these states.

280
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,400
So once again, du/dT is zero.

281
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,980
You change the temperature and
the configurational energy

282
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,230
doesn't change.

283
00:16:59,230 --> 00:17:02,810
So the heat capacity
is zero again.

284
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,360
This is why it's so informative
to measure heat

285
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,110
capacities.

286
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:10,040
Because you can learn an awful
lot about the intrinsic

287
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,000
structure of the material.

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,260
What are the energy levels
available to it?

289
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,890
What do they do?

290
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:18,930
You can learn a tremendous
amount about that by making

291
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:20,960
measurements of the
heat capacity.

292
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:24,690
Well, now we're in
a different case.

293
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:30,350
We have a whole set of evenly
spaced energy levels.

294
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,550
Never ends.

295
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:36,680
So now let's look at the
high temperature limit.

296
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,170
But we're never in a limit
that's higher than the highest

297
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:43,430
level, because we're assuming
it goes on forever.

298
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,420
So it's up here somewhere.

299
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,400
There's kT.

300
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,320
So what happens?

301
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,220
Well if you raise the
temperature, there still are

302
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:54,970
higher lying levels that can
be populated, and that will

303
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,190
get populated.

304
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,210
So du/dT isn't going to be zero
in the high temperature

305
00:17:59,210 --> 00:18:00,550
limit, in this case.

306
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:04,660
But it stops changing
at some point.

307
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,060
Because nothing's very different
about this than

308
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,480
having kT be, let's say,
up here or up here.

309
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,580
So in the high temperature
limit, yes, the energy does

310
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,920
change with temperature.

311
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:22,270
But it changes in the same
way at any temperature.

312
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,950
In other words, the energy is
just linearly varying with

313
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,320
temperature.

314
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,910
And the heat capacity is a
constant. du/dT doesn't change

315
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:34,880
anymore, once you're in the
high temperature limit.

316
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,760
Now without me writing any
expression on the board,

317
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,510
what's the low temperature limit
of the heat capacity

318
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:45,240
going to be in this case?

319
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,480
Going to be on the exam.

320
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,490
STUDENT: Zero?

321
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:51,690
PROFESSOR: Zero, that's still
going to be the same, right?

322
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,650
Put kT way down here.

323
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,780
That's just like this, right?

324
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,340
Not near enough energy to
populate even though lowest,

325
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,320
you know, the first level
above the ground state.

326
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,800
Change the temperature a little
bit, still not enough

327
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,690
thermal energy to
get up there.

328
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,020
So the energy doesn't change
with temperature in that low

329
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,790
temperature limit.

330
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,790
So you can immediately see
what's going to happen at low

331
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:33,440
temperature.

332
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,020
Any questions?

333
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,230
Yeah?

334
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:42,902
STUDENT: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]
will still be n k t, and

335
00:19:42,902 --> 00:19:43,320
then it's just --

336
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:43,760
[UNINTELLIGIBLE]

337
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,425
PROFESSOR: So, of
course, that's a

338
00:19:45,425 --> 00:19:48,300
limiting case here, right?

339
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:51,640
That happened because in the
limit of high temperature,

340
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,000
then this exponent is
really small, right?

341
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,770
So then you can Taylor
expand it.

342
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,120
In the limit of low
temperature,

343
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,310
this is really big.

344
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:04,770
This is nearly zero.

345
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:09,050
So e epsilon zero is much bigger
than kT in that case.

346
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,170
This is big.

347
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,070
This is negligible, right?

348
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:14,370
Oh.

349
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:19,470
Wait a minute.

350
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,800
Something's making
me real unhappy.

351
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:42,890
I can't have this right.

352
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,790
Ah.

353
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:46,160
Yes.

354
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,480
It needs to be zero, is
what it needs to be.

355
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,110
What am I thinking?

356
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,430
Of course.

357
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,560
It's one over a huge number.

358
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,310
It's zero.

359
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:55,480
OK.

360
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,260
So of course you can't
expanded it.

361
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,000
It's just, this is much
bigger than this.

362
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,830
This is an enormous number
at that point.

363
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,220
So in other words, what it's
saying is the configurational

364
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:11,720
energy is zero, because
everything is stuck in the

365
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,660
ground state.

366
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,960
And it stays zero if you
vary the temperature.

367
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,860
So you get the zero limiting
value for the heat capacity,

368
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,910
and the energy itself
is also zero.

369
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,490
Other questions?

370
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:32,930
OK.

371
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,030
Let me just make a few comments
about the entropy.

372
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:42,120
So I didn't write
it out before.

373
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:47,040
And I'm tempted not to
do it again, but I

374
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:57,260
suppose I'll do it.

375
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,320
So it turns out to be Nk, minus
log of one minus e to

376
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,710
the minus epsilon
zero over kT.

377
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:10,570
Plus epsilon zero over kT.

378
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:19,930
Over e to the epsilon zero
over kT, minus one.

379
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:24,320
And this comes from combining
the terms for A and u.

380
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:36,840
It comes from minus A over T.
Plus u over T. And what I want

381
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,040
to do is look at its limiting
cases also.

382
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,120
In particular, what happens
here in the limit of high

383
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:58,560
temperature.

384
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:07,620
And what happens turns out to be
k log kT over epsilon zero

385
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,450
to the Nth power.

386
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,010
Or put the N over here.

387
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:19,910
OK.

388
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:24,210
And what this is telling us
about is the number of

389
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,360
available states.

390
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:31,140
Roughly, how many states are
there that are accessible to

391
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,860
the system at some
temperature.

392
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,470
So in other words, think of it
as -- let's put the N back

393
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,270
there. k log of kT over epsilon
zero to the Nth power.

394
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:47,260
And think of it as k
log capital omega.

395
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,880
Where that would be
the degeneracy.

396
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,810
Now all the states are in equal
energy, but remember for

397
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,070
the whole system, remember
we discussed this before.

398
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,960
How you have a very, very narrow
distribution of system

399
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,360
energy states at equilibrium.

400
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,460
So you can think of this as the
degeneracy of the system

401
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,230
states that are actually going
to exist at a particular

402
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:16,090
temperature.

403
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:28,670
So if we look at the limiting
value of the partition

404
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:34,780
function, it's just
kT over omega.

405
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:44,660
Or the same thing for
capital Q. kT over

406
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,110
epsilon zero, sorry.

407
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,750
To the Nth power.

408
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,140
So you have a very simple
expression.

409
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,500
And so again, what this is
doing, is it's giving us a

410
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,350
measure of about how many
states are available.

411
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,290
And it's particularly
informative to look at that

412
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:03,180
for the molecular partition
function.

413
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:13,110
What it's telling us is, if
I look at kT over epsilon.

414
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:15,160
And these levels, remember,
are evenly spaced.

415
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:19,730
So here's epsilon zero, two
epsilon zero, three epsilon

416
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,730
zero, and so on.

417
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:28,060
It says, you know, if kT is
about ten times bigger than

418
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,780
epsilon zero.

419
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:34,460
So this is ten.

420
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,760
It's telling us, roughly how
many states does the system

421
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,840
have thermal access to.

422
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,170
The molecular state.

423
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:45,320
It has about ten states.

424
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,920
So going over to our picture of
the set of structures, you

425
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,630
could have anywhere up to
about ten bonds broken.

426
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,520
Now, the individual molecules
are going to be in a whole

427
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,480
range of states.

428
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,450
Some of them will have fewer
than that, and some of them

429
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:06,690
will have more than that
number of bonds broken.

430
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:12,040
But on average, it's going
to be about that number.

431
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,870
And then, if you look at the
whole system, the number of

432
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,510
states available, of course
it's astronomical.

433
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:23,995
Because you have to take each
molecule, and say, well it

434
00:26:23,995 --> 00:26:26,540
could be in any one of
something on the

435
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,080
order of ten states.

436
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,060
And then whole set of N other
molecules can be in the states

437
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,400
they might be in.

438
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,790
Change the first one,
and do it again.

439
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:40,540
So you have this astronomical
number of system states.

440
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,840
But remember, like we discussed
once before, it'll

441
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,000
turn out that although the
individual molecule states

442
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,800
vary considerably with energy,
the system states, which are

443
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:57,350
averaging over some astronomical
number of

444
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,150
molecules, where capital
N is something

445
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,460
like ten to the 24th.

446
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:06,490
Once you average over that many
individual molecules, you

447
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:08,540
find that there's very,
very little

448
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,110
fluctuation in the energy.

449
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,000
In the system energy.

450
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,050
The individual molecule energies
vary considerably.

451
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:21,370
Realistically the variation of
the molecular energies -- that

452
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,200
variation is going
to be comparable

453
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,210
to the energy itself.

454
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,260
To the average energy.

455
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,690
So if the average energy is
roughly you know, the ten

456
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:33,550
epsilon zero, you say okay,
how much might it vary?

457
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,550
Well, there are going to be some
molecules that have only

458
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,240
a couple of bonds broken,
and some that might

459
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,070
have 20 bonds broken.

460
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:42,120
The variation will be on the
same order of magnitude as the

461
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,550
average itself.

462
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,450
But then you average over
capital N of them.

463
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:51,840
And then you immediately
discover that there's very,

464
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,960
very, very little variation.

465
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:03,870
And in particular, what happens
then, is, you know,

466
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:14,970
for molecular average energy,
epsilon zero, and variance, or

467
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:22,950
standard deviation about
the same magnitude.

468
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:29,830
System average energy is
u, and it's going to

469
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:31,940
be capital N times.

470
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,490
Well let's say that
-- average --

471
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:38,350
Oh sorry, let me not
put the zero There.

472
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,650
It's just average energy.

473
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,620
And the system average energy
is just N times

474
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,820
the molecular energy.

475
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:56,180
But the system variance is going
to be on the order of

476
00:28:56,180 --> 00:29:02,300
the square root of
N times epsilon.

477
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,990
If you've done statistics,
then you've seen

478
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,050
that sort of result.

479
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:09,740
You do a bunch of samplings a
capital N number of samplings,

480
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,180
and the variation looks
like the square

481
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,140
root of that number.

482
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,240
So what ends up happening
then, if you look at the

483
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,900
relative variation, you might
look and then say, well it's

484
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,440
pretty big.

485
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,720
This is ten to the 12, right?

486
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,860
It's still a huge variance.

487
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:47,140
But let's compare it
to the average.

488
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,150
So this is ten to the 24th.

489
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,160
This is ten to the 12th.

490
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,820
It's on the order of ten
to the minus 12.

491
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,840
An incredibly tiny fractional
variation

492
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,930
in the system energy.

493
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,940
You could never --

494
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,540
There would be no practical
way to measure it.

495
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,800
And of course that is
consistent with

496
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,550
what you would expect.

497
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:12,150
If you say let's measure the
configurational energy of a

498
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,090
bunch of molecules in a liquid
solution, or molecules in a

499
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,320
gas floating around.

500
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,960
And it's a mole of them, that
total average energy is not

501
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,160
going to fluctuate
significantly, even though

502
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,570
individual molecules that you
pick out of that whole system

503
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,700
might have quite widely
varying energies.

504
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,250
And that's the point.

505
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,740
So it's an incredibly
small variation.

506
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,500
Now you can derive this.

507
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,870
I didn't derive this,
of course.

508
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:43,080
I asserted that this
is the case.

509
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,540
And it's probably familiar to
some of you if you've seen

510
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,270
some statistics.

511
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,710
But the way you would derive it
is, you know in addition to

512
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:52,700
calculating the average energy,
the average of E, you

513
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,340
can also calculate the average
of the energy squared.

514
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,980
And you can calculate the
standard deviation that way.

515
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,590
You calculate the average
of E squared.

516
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:05,670
And then you minus the average
of E, the quantity squared.

517
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:06,390
Take the square root.

518
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:09,180
That's your root mean square.

519
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:13,040
And that's what leads
to this result.

520
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,400
So it's pretty straight forward
to calculate it also.

521
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:17,910
Alright.

522
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:21,230
So any questions about just the
extent of variation of the

523
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:27,370
individual molecule energies
or the system energies?

524
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,330
Okay.

525
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:42,250
Then, now what I'd like to do
is look at another kind of

526
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,450
energy that's going to turn out
to have exactly the same

527
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:48,650
set of levels that
we just derived

528
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:50,480
from this simple model.

529
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,670
And some of you may have
seen this before.

530
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:55,010
Many of you may not have.

531
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:57,350
And for right now, I'll
just assert it.

532
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:00,360
But it will illustrate why
this is so useful.

533
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,270
It turns out that if I've got
molecular vibrations -- you

534
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,310
know, there's nitrogen and
oxygen in the air.

535
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,640
If I look at those nitrogen
vibrational energy levels.

536
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,930
Or oxygen energy levels.

537
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:17,280
They look like this.

538
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:23,220
Evenly spaced, non degenerate
energy levels.

539
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,730
So the model that we've
constructed here, based on

540
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:34,230
this simple two-chain polymer,
actually gives us a set of

541
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:38,180
energy levels that maps directly
onto the vibrational

542
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:40,700
energy levels of a molecule.

543
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:50,890
So all the results that we've
just seen apply, not just for

544
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:57,410
conformations of a
polymer, but for

545
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:59,220
vibrations of a molecule.

546
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:04,200
So everywhere where it says
configurational, you can just

547
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,900
write in vibrational.

548
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,040
And you'll still be right.
because of course, what

549
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:15,000
matters is what are the states
that are available to the

550
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,130
system, and what are
their energies?

551
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,880
After that, the formalism of
statistical mechanics takes

552
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,140
over, and calculates partition
functions and

553
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,610
thermodynamic functions.

554
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,380
The input into that is states.

555
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,880
And their energies.

556
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,200
Well, we have the exact same
set of states and energies.

557
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,630
So we immediately arrive at a
super important case and its

558
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,030
results for molecular
vibrations.

559
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:51,590
And not only molecular
vibrations, but vibrations of

560
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:57,000
a crystal lattice.

561
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,440
Acoustic vibrations
of a glass.

562
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,380
Or even a liquid.

563
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:07,140
So there's an enormously wide
ranging set of results that

564
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,020
we've derived by starting
at this simple picture.

565
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,670
And when you take quantum
mechanics, you'll see that

566
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:19,250
indeed you do get this set of
evenly spaced energy levels.

567
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:21,530
You may well have seen the
results before, and you'll see

568
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,100
it derived there.

569
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,180
OK.

570
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:31,050
Given that, then I want to
talk a little bit further

571
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:33,620
about the heat capacity.

572
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:39,360
So we've seen the limiting cases
for the heat capacity.

573
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,380
Namely, the low temperature
limit is zero.

574
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,150
That's the case whenever you
have quantized levels.

575
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:49,340
You can always get kT lower
by far than the

576
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:52,060
lowest excited state.

577
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,550
So that everything is stuck
in the ground state.

578
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,770
How low that is depends
on how far apart

579
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:57,720
the states are spaced.

580
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,350
But there's got to be some
temperature somewhere that's

581
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:02,490
down there.

582
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:16,310
So we've seen the heat capacity
limiting cases.

583
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:36,670
Let me just sort of
draw them again.

584
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:41,200
So here's kT much less
than epsilon zero.

585
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,750
And up here, kT is much bigger
than epsilon zero.

586
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,510
Now I'm just going to sketch
the full temperature

587
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:50,990
dependence.

588
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:53,130
In other words, I'm going to
connect those two limits that

589
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,130
we've seen.

590
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:14,990
So here's what that
looks like.

591
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:20,600
And I'll write it
as vibrational.

592
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:25,200
So we know it's got to be zero
at the low temperature limit.

593
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:30,390
And we know that it's this
constant value in the high

594
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,550
temperature limit.

595
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,110
It's Nk.

596
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:40,790
And in some way, it
smoothly connects.

597
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:44,470
And if you look at the actual
scale, here -- so here's kT

598
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:47,340
over epsilon zero.

599
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:48,920
Here's the limit of
low temperature.

600
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,910
Actually, you don't have to be
very high above epsilon zero

601
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,430
to be in in this high
temperature limit.

602
00:36:55,430 --> 00:37:00,360
So if you look at the plot
that's on your notes, this is

603
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,790
already -- it's not quite
leveling off precisely.

604
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:04,940
But it's already pretty close.

605
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:10,290
When kT is just two times
epsilon zero.

606
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:22,300
It's already almost at
the limiting case.

607
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,960
Now this has tremendous
significance.

608
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,230
So a long time before quantum
mechanics was developed,

609
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,760
people made measurements
of the heat

610
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,450
capacities of materials.

611
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:37,830
And they were familiar with the
fact that when you got to

612
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:41,580
ordinary temperature -- room
temperature, the heat capacity

613
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:45,960
was temperature independent.

614
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,500
And that was understandable
for reasons

615
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,990
we'll discuss shortly.

616
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:55,150
Basically, in that case, the
heat capacity -- it's not just

617
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,720
Nk for one vibrational mode.

618
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,600
Of course, that's what I
describe for a single

619
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,710
vibrational mode of,
say, a molecule.

620
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:06,120
If you have a crystal lattice
with N atoms in it.

621
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,440
Let's say it's an
atomic crystal.

622
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,610
Each atom has three degrees
of freedom.

623
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,550
It can move in each of three
independent directions.

624
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,930
And there are N of
those atoms.

625
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,080
There are 3N total degrees
of freedom.

626
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:23,570
That's how many vibrations
the lattice has.

627
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:29,070
So in fact, you have to
multiply this by 3N.

628
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:34,580
So what would be seen is,
you'd have 3R, the gas

629
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:38,680
constant, per mole,
in other words.

630
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,550
And if you looked at Cv
over 3R, then this

631
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,160
value would be one.

632
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,290
Very useful to see that.

633
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:55,250
To figure that out.

634
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,970
And people understood it.

635
00:38:56,970 --> 00:39:03,190
What people didn't understand
is this stuff.

636
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:06,740
Why did it do that?

637
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,830
That was a great mystery.

638
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:13,110
Why did the heat capacity go
to zero at low temperature?

639
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:15,870
And the reason they didn't
understand it is because the

640
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:18,980
model for vibration
was really simple.

641
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,960
The lattice is a bunch of
masses and springs.

642
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:25,060
I know the vibrational energy.

643
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,810
And I can calculate it.

644
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:31,890
That is, I know the classical
vibrational energy.

645
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,880
Remember, the reason it
goes to zero is this.

646
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,150
It's all because of the fact
that the energy levels are

647
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,460
discrete, quantized levels,
with gaps in between them.

648
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,730
If I've got classical mechanics,
then that means

649
00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:48,850
it's vibrational energy.

650
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,770
The energy just gets bigger if
the amplitude get bigger.

651
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:54,420
It's not discrete,
it's continuous.

652
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,690
There are always energies
in there.

653
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,790
In that case, there's never
a situation like this.

654
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:03,600
Where kT is lower than the first
available excited level,

655
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,650
and everything's in
the ground state.

656
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,830
That never happens in classical
mechanics, because

657
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:09,390
there are always levels there.

658
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,250
But it does happen in
quantum mechanics.

659
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:17,910
And Einstein recognized that
this was a way to explain this

660
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,800
low temperature limiting
heat capacity.

661
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,200
So actually if you look at early
development of quantum

662
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,990
mechanics, really it
was all predicated

663
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:28,780
on statistical mechanics.

664
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:31,790
And the idea that, well, that
you could then do the

665
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:35,400
statistical mechanics with
quantized levels, just the way

666
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,260
we've done it.

667
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,070
And what you immediately
discover is, gee,

668
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,330
it all makes sense.

669
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:43,100
You go to low temperature,
everything's stunk down here.

670
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,160
And suddenly you've got zero
heat capacity, because you

671
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,890
changed the temperature a little
bit, and everything is

672
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:51,680
still stuck back here.

673
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,800
So that's the vibrational heat
capacity of a solid.

674
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,890
That's what it looks like.

675
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,230
And at moderate temperature,
this doesn't have to be very

676
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:03,280
much bigger than epsilon zero.

677
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,410
You're already in, essentially,
the limit.

678
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:06,520
The high temperature limit.

679
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,140
And now for molecules, that
limit isn't usually reached at

680
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,640
room temperature.

681
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:20,570
Here's a kind of calibration.
kT at room temperature is

682
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:27,480
about equal to 200
wave numbers.

683
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:32,020
So molecular vibrations, you
know, you've taken IR spectra

684
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:36,190
they're typically on the order
of 1,000 wave numbers or so.

685
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:40,540
kT isn't bigger than the
vibrational energy.

686
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:43,330
But a crystal lattice, you know
the vibrations are the

687
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,560
acoustics vibrations.

688
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,770
And those are much lower
in frequency.

689
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:52,590
If you have an atomic crystal,
it just has the sound

690
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,750
vibrations at all the different

691
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,830
wavelengths that are available.

692
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:58,890
They're never very high.

693
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:01,890
So it's easy to get into
the high temperature

694
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:04,700
limit, in that case.

695
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,660
Where you basically
see a temperature

696
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:14,720
independent heat capacity.

697
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,720
OK.

698
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,440
By the way, this was actually
used commonly to determine the

699
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,860
molecular weights of
molecular crystals.

700
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,060
Because you've got a factor of
the number of moles in there.

701
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,670
If you ask how big is
the heat capacity?

702
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:28,270
Well it does depend on
how many moles of

703
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:29,590
material you have.

704
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,360
Because it depends on
how many atoms.

705
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,130
That control how many modes
there are in the crystal.

706
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:35,510
How many vibrational modes.

707
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:39,050
Because each atom has 3N
degrees of freedom.

708
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,830
So if you just weigh the whole
crystal, and then you measure

709
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:44,390
the heat capacity, you know how
many moles there are, and

710
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:45,830
now you know the weight,
you can figure out

711
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,660
the molecular weight.

712
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,150
OK.

713
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,860
So that's the low temperature
limit.

714
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,670
And now I want to talk a little
bit further about the

715
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,670
high temperature limit.

716
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:04,510
And in particular, I want to
talk about both the heat

717
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:07,510
capacity and the energy
that we've seen.

718
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:11,060
Namely, this thing.

719
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:14,070
Of course it's really the same
result for the energy and the

720
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:14,900
heat capacity.

721
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,720
They're obviously intimately
connected.

722
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,340
So these are the high
temperature limits.

723
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:32,470
Now it turns out that that high
temperature limit doesn't

724
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,150
just obtain for vibrations.

725
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,270
But it's also the case for
molecular rotations,

726
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:41,680
translations.

727
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,860
All these low energy
degrees of freedom.

728
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,050
So let's see why.

729
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,880
It has a name, that result.

730
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:59,980
It's called the equipartition
of energy.

731
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:06,760
Sometimes it's called the
classical equipartition of

732
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,970
energy theorem.

733
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:22,460
And what it says is one half
kT per degree of freedom

734
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:31,040
equals energy in the
high T limit.

735
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,440
And in particular, for
translation, so E

736
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,390
translational is 3/2.

737
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:49,900
Well, NkT for N atoms.

738
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:55,250
Or molecules.

739
00:44:55,250 --> 00:45:00,890
E rotational is, now it depends
how many rotational

740
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:02,770
degrees of freedom there are.

741
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:05,170
If I've got a linear molecule,
there are only two.

742
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:08,320
It can rotate this way, and
it can rotate this way.

743
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:11,140
If I've got a non linear
molecule, parts all over the

744
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,410
place, it has three
unique axes.

745
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:15,890
It can also spin this way.

746
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:17,880
And that's a rotational
degree of freedom.

747
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,510
Of course the linear molecule
wasn't like that.

748
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:23,340
Nothing is moving when
you do that.

749
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:30,050
So it's either NkT, linear.

750
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,120
Or 3/2 NkT.

751
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:34,770
Non linear.

752
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,560
Great.

753
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:49,500
And then E vibrational is NkT
per vibrational mode.

754
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,420
That's because vibrational
energy is potential and

755
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,390
kinetic energy, and
it's 1/2 kT each.

756
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,510
Why does all that
stuff happen?

757
00:45:59,510 --> 00:46:10,040
Turns out, you can see
why pretty easily.

758
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,580
All those degrees of freedom.

759
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:20,710
Those classical degrees
of freedom.

760
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:31,400
If you say, let's write out an
expression for the energy.

761
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,910
Classical.

762
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:39,760
You know it's 1/2 m v squared.

763
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,590
Or it's 1/2 k x squared.

764
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:51,080
Or for rotational energy it's
1/2 I omega squared.

765
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,850
You see a functional
form emerging here?

766
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,380
That looks similar in
all these cases?

767
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:59,070
You know, 1/2 times some
constant, times

768
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:03,130
some variable squared.

769
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:11,820
Well, now let's look at our
expressions for the energy.

770
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:16,260
Average energy.

771
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:21,650
We're going to sum over all the
energies of epsilon i, e

772
00:47:21,650 --> 00:47:25,050
to the minus Ei over kT.

773
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:30,420
Over sum over i, e to the
minus Ei over kT.

774
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:34,960
That's just how we originally
derived the average of energy.

775
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,800
In other words, it's the
probability of each state

776
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,340
times the energy
of that state.

777
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:44,320
Summed up over all the states.

778
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:47,560
Well, now we have an expression
for the energy.

779
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:48,700
It's one of these things.

780
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:53,670
It's something times
a variable squared.

781
00:47:53,670 --> 00:48:01,210
So, we'll use some general
functional form, a y squared.

782
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:04,670
And now, let's assume we're in
the high temperature limit.

783
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,570
And we've seen what
that means.

784
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:11,060
It means kT is big,
compared to the

785
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:13,580
separation between the energies.

786
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,450
When that's the case, there
are lots of these

787
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,580
terms in the sum.

788
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:18,120
We can convert them
to integrals.

789
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,390
We can forget about
the fact that the

790
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,390
energies are discrete.

791
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,400
We can say look, they're
so close

792
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,590
together, compared to kT.

793
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:29,850
That we can turn the sums
into integrals.

794
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:36,680
So then we have integrals
instead of sums.

795
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:37,600
And here's our energy.

796
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,070
It's a y squared.

797
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:39,930
Whatever that is.

798
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:41,680
It could be this, it could be
this, it could be this.

799
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,880
And it's not going to matter.
e to the minus a y squared

800
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:54,880
over kT over, integral over e to
the minus a y squared over

801
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,570
kT. dy, dy.

802
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,650
OK.

803
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,710
And here's what's
going to happen.

804
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,280
If you do this integral
by parts.

805
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,160
This one.

806
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:16,800
What ends up happening is it
gives you this integral times

807
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,370
a certain number.

808
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:23,200
This is going to come
out of the integral.

809
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,410
And so it will turn out.

810
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:27,920
And it's straightforward
to do it.

811
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,720
It's in the notes.

812
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,700
It goes through.

813
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:31,680
But I'll just write
the result here.

814
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,850
The result is that you get, in
this high temperature limit

815
00:49:35,850 --> 00:49:42,370
where you've gone to the
integral form, you get 1/2 kT.

816
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,790
And it will always
be the case.

817
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:47,530
All you need to know is the
form of the energy.

818
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:49,260
As long as that's the case --

819
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:52,920
Remember y is just a variable
of integration here.

820
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,460
That's not going to
be preserved.

821
00:49:56,460 --> 00:50:00,070
This comes out because
of what happens here.

822
00:50:00,070 --> 00:50:03,520
So what that's telling you is
whenever you have an energy of

823
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:07,320
this form, and you're in the
high temperature limit, then

824
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,860
you get this classical

825
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,110
equipartition of energy result.

826
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:16,610
So, for translation, of course
there are three separate

827
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,770
degrees of freedom.

828
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,300
For velocity in the x,
y, or z direction.

829
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:23,640
For rotation, if it's a linear
molecule, let's say there are

830
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,740
two separate degrees
of freedom.

831
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,660
You have to keep track of
how many degrees of

832
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:27,630
freedom there are.

833
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:29,710
But that's all you have to do.

834
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:31,300
That's enormously powerful.

835
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,590
It means that without doing
anything, I know the average

836
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:39,070
translational energy of the
molecules in this room.

837
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,270
Because of course I'm certainly
in the high

838
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:41,170
temperature limit.

839
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,820
With respect to translational
energy levels, they're really

840
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,370
closely spaced.

841
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:48,250
Same with rotations.

842
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,210
Now at room temperature
vibrations, forget it.

843
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:53,950
I have essentially no
vibrational energy.

844
00:50:53,950 --> 00:50:57,460
I'm at the low temperature
limit for the molecular

845
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,500
vibrations of nitrogen
or oxygen.

846
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,700
Those are high in frequency.

847
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:04,570
So much higher than
200 wavenumbers.

848
00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:07,990
But for each molecule,
I have 3/2 kT of

849
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:09,680
translational energy.

850
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,650
Linear molecules, I have kT
of rotational energy.

851
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,890
Without doing any work at all.

852
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:18,400
And since that applies to most
molecules at room temperature,

853
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,390
it's an incredibly useful, very,
very general result.

854
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:22,860
OK.

855
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:26,320
Next time we'll do a little bit
of chemistry, and look at

856
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,910
phase transformations.
