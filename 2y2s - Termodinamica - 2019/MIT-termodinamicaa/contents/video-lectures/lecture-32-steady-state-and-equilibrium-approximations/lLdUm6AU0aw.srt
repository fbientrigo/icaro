8
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:21,860
PROFESSOR: So, any
questions from last time?

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:27,090
We started doing
reaction mechanisms.

10
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,430
We did first order
parallel reactions.

11
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,280
So one of the things
that we'll be stressing

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,630
is that the mechanisms
that we write down

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:46,560
are ways to try to understand
a complicated chemical process.

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,510
And you take data, you can
find intermediates sometimes.

15
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:56,740
And you get rate
laws from the data.

16
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,220
You infer rate laws.

17
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,470
And from these rate
laws, you think up

18
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:08,890
of a reaction mechanism and you
make sure that what you measure

19
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,460
is consistent with
your mechanism

20
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:15,051
that you make up to explain the
complicated chemical process.

21
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,800
And one really important
thing to remember

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,860
is that when you come
up with a mechanism

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,800
and you've got a bunch of data
that supports it, it's great.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,270
But it doesn't mean that
you've solve the problem.

25
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,400
It doesn't mean
that you've proven

26
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,280
that the way that the
chemistry proceeds

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,780
is really the way it proceeds.

28
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,822
Because there's
always the possibility

29
00:01:40,822 --> 00:01:42,780
that there's an intermediate
somewhere in there

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,930
that you haven't
been able to measure.

31
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,280
And a lot of people
got tripped up

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,500
over the course of
the last century,

33
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:55,700
of making up mechanisms, getting
a lot of data that supports

34
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:01,760
the mechanism and missing
something really important.

35
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,350
So it's a common
mistake, that people

36
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,660
think they've proven
a particular chemical

37
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:12,880
mechanism just because they
have data that supports it.

38
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,450
It's up to a certain point
that you know what you have.

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,330
And we'll see examples
of that today, probably.

40
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:22,660
And then certainly
next time when

41
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,000
we start making approximations
in our kinetics.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,990
And see where things
can really go wrong

43
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,600
if you don't have enough data.

44
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,330
If you don't try
to fish out really,

45
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,680
really, tiny intermediates
somewhere along the way.

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,510
So last time we did then
parallel first order reactions.

47
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:45,980
And today we're going
to march through and do

48
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,960
parallel first and second order.

49
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,180
So one is first order, the
other one is second order.

50
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,260
Things are going to
get more complicated.

51
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,010
And what you're going
to get is a flavor

52
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,950
of how to solve the problems.

53
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:57,319
Setting up the problems.

54
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,860
We're not going to do a lot of
the algebra here on the board,

55
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,870
because otherwise we
would spend the next three

56
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,080
weeks doing algebra.

57
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,095
And that would be no fun at all.

58
00:03:06,095 --> 00:03:07,470
That doesn't mean
that you're not

59
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,360
going to be doing any
algebra on the homework.

60
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,520
Because part of it is
figuring how to do it.

61
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:22,090
So, we have a reaction
where A goes to B plus C.

62
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,480
And the first thing we did
was, the first mechanism

63
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
we wrote was a parallel
mechanism where

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:34,240
we had A goes B and A goes
to C. That's the mechanism.

65
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,810
And one other way to write
it is A goes to B or C,

66
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:47,810
in a way that is more,
sort of describes

67
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,830
the branching
process, that when we

68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,810
talk about a branching ratio,
the ratio of amount of B to C,

69
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,020
this looks like the branching
out of two different paths.

70
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,520
And this time we're going to
do where this is first order

71
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,620
and this is second order.

72
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:13,220
With the rate k1 and a rate k2.

73
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,150
And the way that you
do all these problems,

74
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:18,284
you have to be very
systematic about it.

75
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:19,700
The first thing
you do is you have

76
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,240
to write down all
your rate laws.

77
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,470
And make sure that you
include everything.

78
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,830
So you start by writing the rate
law for the destruction of A.

79
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:32,260
And then the rate law for the
appearance of B and for C.

80
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,940
So for a, we have dA/dt.

81
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,090
And again, I'm dropping
the brackets around the A,

82
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:41,030
because I don't want to carry
around all these extra symbols.

83
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:47,990
So we destroy A by making B. So
that's going to be first order.

84
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,721
And then we also
destroy A by making C,

85
00:04:49,721 --> 00:04:50,720
and that's second order.

86
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,420
So we have two paths out
of A. To get rid of A.

87
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:02,660
Then we write down the
appearance of B, dB/dt.

88
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:08,710
It's only through one
path, first order in A,

89
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:13,430
and then the appearance
of C, only one path

90
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:16,305
which is second order.

91
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:18,180
And these are all our
differential equations.

92
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,900
And now the trick is, how do you
solve these three differential

93
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:32,300
equations in a way that you
get meaningful information out.

94
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,490
Well, the first
thing to do is to,

95
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,532
so these two here depend on
A. So the appearance of B

96
00:05:41,532 --> 00:05:43,490
depends on A, the appearance
of C depends on A.

97
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,490
But this one here only
depends on A by itself.

98
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,904
So this is the first one
you're going to start out with.

99
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:49,320
Because you can
put all of the A's

100
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,530
on one side and all the time on
the other side and integrate.

101
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:59,340
So then you solve, and
you can rewrite this

102
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:10,740
as minus dA/dt is equal to
k1 times A times one plus k2

103
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,630
over k1 times A. And then you
put all the A's on one side,

104
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,950
all the t's on the other side.

105
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:30,580
And integrate from A0 to A minus
dA over A times one plus k2

106
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:39,430
over k1 times A. That is
equal to k1 from zero to t dt.

107
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,485
And then you have to
solve this integral here.

108
00:06:41,485 --> 00:06:44,410
And there's a reason why
I factored out the A here.

109
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,910
It's because this
is of the form you

110
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,810
can use to use the trick
of partial fractions, which

111
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,900
we mentioned this before.

112
00:06:51,900 --> 00:07:01,650
So you use partial
fractions to solve this.

113
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,380
And I'm not going to
do it on the board.

114
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,270
You turn the crank,
you basically

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,560
write one over A times
one plus k2 over k1 A

116
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,184
is equal to n1 of A plus
n2 over this part here,

117
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,350
and you solve for n1 and
n2 and you plug it back in,

118
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,730
and you redo your
integral, et cetera.

119
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,802
And you get your answer.

120
00:07:19,802 --> 00:07:21,510
Which I'm going to
write down because I'm

121
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:29,170
going to use it
later. k1 A0 over e

122
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:36,195
to the k1 times
t, k1 plus k2 A0.

123
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,820
So one of the things
we immediately see

124
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,930
is even though this mechanism
isn't very complicated,

125
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,470
just two paths, one first order,
one second order, the solutions

126
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:53,080
start to get not so
simple pretty quickly.

127
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,590
So it depends, there's an
exponential on the bottom here.

128
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,700
Depends on the initial
concentrations and both rate

129
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,205
constants are in there.

130
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:03,580
The first thing
you want to do is

131
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,900
you want to look
at limiting cases.

132
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,080
Just like before.

133
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,520
We did, and the
first limiting case

134
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,300
we're going to look at,
so interesting to look at

135
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,110
is this guy right
here. k1 and k2 A here.

136
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,870
If one is bigger than the other,
then things will cancel out.

137
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,620
And we can get some intuition.

138
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,270
So the first limiting case
we're going to look at

139
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:43,961
is where k2 A0, this term right
here, is much smaller than k1.

140
00:08:43,961 --> 00:08:46,210
Now, we want to make sure
that in these limiting cases

141
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,160
that when I write something like
this, that the units actually

142
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,080
make sense.

143
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,200
That I'm not
saying, three apples

144
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
are less than four oranges.

145
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,870
So k1, it's first
order, so the units

146
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,950
are one over second. k2, it's
a second order rate constant,

147
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:07,534
so the units are one over second
molar, times moles per liter.

148
00:09:07,534 --> 00:09:08,950
So the moles per
liters cancel out

149
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,920
and I have one over our second
is less than one over second,

150
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,160
so things are great.

151
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,320
It I'm making the right
kind of approximation here.

152
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,110
What else is this
approximation saying?

153
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:23,650
This is saying that the
rate into B, so this one is

154
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,670
the faster one. k1, the rate
into B, is the rate into,

155
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:32,580
is k1, is faster than k2 times
A, which is basically the rate

156
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:41,055
into C. So this is saying that
the rate into B, to form B,

157
00:09:41,055 --> 00:09:53,250
is faster than into C. So
we can write down a sketch.

158
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:57,970
We can sketch what we expect
this approximation to be, then.

159
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,370
And we know it's going to
look something like this.

160
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,290
We know that A is going to
come down, exponentially.

161
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,938
Without any structure to it.

162
00:10:11,938 --> 00:10:13,646
It's going to go either
into B or into C,

163
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,840
in some branching fractions.

164
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,430
And we know that the rate
into B is faster than into C,

165
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,440
so B is going to
come up like this.

166
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,510
And C is going to
come up, but slower.

167
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:34,660
And there's going to be a
ratio between these two guys.

168
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,400
So we know the slope here
is going to be slower

169
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,140
then the slope for B. And
we can check that out,

170
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,980
within our approximation.

171
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,511
We can write, at t
equals zero, find out

172
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:48,760
what these initial slopes are.

173
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:52,780
For the creation of
B and C. So dB/dt

174
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,150
is the slope of the creation
of B at the beginning.

175
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,930
At t equals zero.

176
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:05,740
And that's just the
rate law. dB/dt at t

177
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:11,830
equals zero is k1 A0.

178
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:21,320
And dC/dt, the initial slope, t
equals zero, is k1 A0 squared.

179
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,430
Or k2 A0 squared, rather.

180
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:36,890
So I'm going to write it as
k2 A0 squared, like this.

181
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:40,130
We said k1 is much
bigger than k2 times A0.

182
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,870
There's the same A0 here.

183
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,730
So we see, just by
writing this down,

184
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,904
that our intuition that
because the rate into B

185
00:11:48,904 --> 00:11:51,320
is much faster than into A,
that it should look like this.

186
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,700
Well it's borne out just
like this very simple sort

187
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:58,640
of looking at the initial
rate where the slope here

188
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:04,220
is much smaller
than the slope here.

189
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,240
And then we can take the
approximation in here.

190
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,330
And see what it implies.

191
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:18,100
So let me do that here, let me
just use my green chalk here.

192
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,520
So k2 A0 is much less than k1.

193
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:27,760
So this is going to go away.
k2 A0 is much less than k1.

194
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,260
Well, this is
building up from zero.

195
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,530
So this is always
bigger than one here.

196
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,171
So I can get rid
of this as well.

197
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,670
Because there's the
k1 sitting here.

198
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,100
And k1 is much
bigger than k2 A0.

199
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,280
Once I got rid of all these two
guys, then the k1's cancel out.

200
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,980
And this is looking very nice.

201
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,110
Because now I can take that e
to the k1 t and put it upstairs.

202
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,380
A is equal to approximately
A0 e to the minus k1 times

203
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,320
time in this approximation.

204
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,870
It looks like it's
first order coming down,

205
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,670
with a rate constant k1.

206
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,250
It looks like basically
the branching into C

207
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,874
is nonexistent as far as, at
least in this approximation,

208
00:13:13,874 --> 00:13:14,790
as far A is concerned.

209
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:19,970
It's going to look
like this thing here.

210
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,650
It's going to look
like first order

211
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,120
A goes to B with
rate constant k1.

212
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,330
So if you didn't
know, if you didn't

213
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:30,520
know that there was
another substance, C,

214
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,290
that was being formed along the
way, if you didn't measure it,

215
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,990
if you didn't do the analytical
chemistry and sort of fish it

216
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:41,870
out, and you just looked at the
two major components, A and B,

217
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:45,130
in this case here, you'd
measure a rate out of A,

218
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,110
it would look like
it's first order.

219
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,380
It's great.

220
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:51,220
Got my mechanism.

221
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,150
A goes to B, period.

222
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,195
And you would know there
was a minor component that

223
00:13:57,195 --> 00:14:02,050
was being formed
at the same time.

224
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:15,560
OK, let's do another
approximation.

225
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:24,917
Let's do the other case, where
k2 A0 is much bigger than k1.

226
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:26,500
And, in this case
here, you have to be

227
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,583
a little bit more careful.

228
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,780
You have to add
that you're going

229
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,300
to look at this at early times.

230
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,240
And we're going to see why
early times is important here.

231
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,610
In just five minutes.

232
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,180
And early times, and how
you define early times.

233
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,000
What does it mean for things to
be close to time equals zero?

234
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,250
Well, we have to have
a reference time scale.

235
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,690
The reactions, I'm
going at a certain rate.

236
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,150
And one second may be very slow.

237
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,120
Or it may be very fast.

238
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,640
Depending on the
rate of the reaction.

239
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:03,220
So k1 here defines the
time scale of the problem.

240
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,640
It's one over second,
unit of one over second.

241
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,250
And early times means that
the times that I'm looking at

242
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:15,620
compare to this rate,
it's very small.

243
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,960
So k1 t is less than one.

244
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,520
That means that the time,
during the time period that I'm

245
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:28,680
looking at, hardly anything has
happened to the branching of A

246
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,360
to B. That that's what
I mean by early time.

247
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,910
So B is hardly being built
up yet. k1 is our reference

248
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:40,590
time. k1 is units
of one over second.

249
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,480
This has units of seconds.

250
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,025
So it's all working out fine.

251
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:47,650
In other words, I would have no
idea how to define early times.

252
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,590
I could say, it's in
a year, it could be,

253
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,320
if you're looking
at plutonium decay,

254
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,850
it's a 100,000 year half-life.

255
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,460
A year would be an early time.

256
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:58,760
So it would be really fast,
compared to the process.

257
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,075
But if you're looking
at a reaction that

258
00:16:01,075 --> 00:16:04,450
takes a few nanoseconds than a
year would be very, very long.

259
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,430
So you really need
your reference time

260
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,030
somewhere in there.

261
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:13,910
So this approximation means
that essentially, no B

262
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,150
is being created.

263
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,400
While we're looking
at the process.

264
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,800
And so we might then
very well expect

265
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,165
that if we look at A and
C, that the answer is going

266
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:29,110
to be that we're going to see
something that's second order.

267
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:35,255
So we expect that the form
of A, the way to write it

268
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:39,140
is going to be one over
A equals k1 t plus A0.

269
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,950
So let's go ahead and
take our complete solution

270
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:46,620
and write it in the way that we
might expect the answer to be.

271
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,500
In terms of one over
A rather than A here.

272
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,760
So let's just invert it. e to
the k1 times time, k1 plus k2

273
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:07,900
A0, minus k2 A0 over k1 A0.

274
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:11,190
This should be a
minus sign here.

275
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,157
There should be a
minus sign here.

276
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:15,740
It didn't matter for
our approximation

277
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,750
because we got rid
of it anyway, but it

278
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:24,120
would be a proper
sign here is minus.

279
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:27,390
And so now we need to
make our approximation

280
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,530
and figure out what this here.

281
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:33,400
So if we take the approximation
that k1 t is small, less

282
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,530
than one, then what that
should trigger in your mind

283
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,770
if that if you have e to
the something that small

284
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,061
you should use a Taylor series.

285
00:17:40,061 --> 00:17:42,990
And expand this into
a Taylor series.

286
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,880
So we're going to see
this multiple times.

287
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,650
So we take e to the k1 t
and expand it out as one

288
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,750
plus k1 t plus et cetera.

289
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,850
We're going to keep the
first order terms in there.

290
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:05,430
So we're going to plug this
approximation into here.

291
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,600
That's this approximation there.

292
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,680
And then we're going
to expand it out.

293
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:21,510
So plug it in here, and, keeping
it to first order in time,

294
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,340
and multiplying it
out, and I'm not

295
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,940
going to do the
intermediate steps,

296
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,990
I'm just going to give
you the stuff after doing

297
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,870
the multiplications,
we get k1 t squared.

298
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:37,130
So that's basically k1
times one plus k1 t,

299
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:45,600
and then you have
plus k1 k2 A0 times t.

300
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,350
That's this term here. k1
k2 A0 times t times that.

301
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:54,190
And the k2 A0 times
one gets subtracted out

302
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,232
from this minus k2 A0 here.

303
00:18:56,232 --> 00:18:57,440
So that's all we have on top.

304
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,304
And then there are terms
of higher order in time.

305
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:01,970
But we're not going
to worry about this.

306
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,670
We're going to stick
to first order in time.

307
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,420
Divided by k1 A0.

308
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,990
And now you do
your cancellations.

309
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:14,530
We have our
approximation at k1 times

310
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,940
time is much less than one.

311
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,600
So here we have k1
times k1 times time.

312
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,980
So this term here means it's
much less than this term

313
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,540
here, because of
our approximations.

314
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:28,960
So we can get rid
of this term here.

315
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,920
Get rid of that.

316
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,690
There's no reason for us to
get rid of this one here.

317
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:40,490
Because we've got k2 A0 there,
which is much larger than k1.

318
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,520
And so when you expand this out,
all the k1's cancel out here.

319
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,660
So so k1 cancels out that
k1, we have one plus one.

320
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:51,340
So this is basically
one over A0.

321
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:54,480
And then we have plus
k2 A0 time over A0,

322
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:07,060
so this ends up being equal to
one over A0 plus k2 times time.

323
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,310
Exactly what we expected.

324
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,990
That if you put in the right
approximation in the math,

325
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:16,270
it behaves as your
intuition would tell you.

326
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:20,140
Which is that the branching
into B nonexistent.

327
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,500
And that you're looking
at everything going to C.

328
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:28,280
It looks second order
in C. But in this case

329
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,040
here, it's only early times.

330
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,740
So if you keep
going, what happens?

331
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,990
If you keep going in
time, beyond the time

332
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:40,360
scale of this first
order rate constant,

333
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,470
and you wait long enough,
then the amount of A

334
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,800
keeps decreasing.

335
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,800
Keeps getting
smaller and smaller.

336
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,580
So if you start the clock
again, a little bit later,

337
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,020
where A is much
smaller, then k2 times

338
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,030
the amount of A you
have there, is no longer

339
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:04,230
going to be much
greater than k1.

340
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,980
At some point along
the way, k2 times A

341
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:13,360
is going to be
much less than k1.

342
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,377
So at some point
along the way, it's

343
00:21:15,377 --> 00:21:17,210
not going to be this
approximation any more.

344
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,400
It's going to be the
previous one that we did.

345
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:22,010
The one up there.

346
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,510
So at early times we
start with something

347
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:29,420
that may look second order for
A. Time goes on, time goes on,

348
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,290
time goes on, A gets depleted.

349
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,170
A gets depleted, and
the rate k2 times

350
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,510
A, which is sitting right
here, this part here

351
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,850
becomes smaller and smaller.

352
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:43,210
And pretty soon this part wins.

353
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,240
And it becomes first order.

354
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,370
So what you'd
expect to see, then,

355
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:59,950
is if you were to plot
as a function of A,

356
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,860
you expect to see something
that starts out as first order

357
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,130
and then as A gets depleted,
switches over to second order.

358
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,220
Something that's
second order here.

359
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:11,550
And first order.

360
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:17,720
This is the concentration of
A. So if you were to plot it,

361
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,260
here you're plotting
the concentration of A.

362
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:26,230
If you were to plot the log,
of the concentration of A,

363
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:29,500
at long times you'd expect
it to be first order.

364
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,960
So something linear.

365
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:35,030
But at early times you'd
expect it to be second order.

366
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,320
So you'd expect to see
something that's nonlinear,

367
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,060
then switching to
something linear.

368
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:47,110
And if you were to
plot it as one over A,

369
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,610
then you'd expect to start off
with something that's linear,

370
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,650
at second order, early times.

371
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:57,130
But instead of keeping,
being second order,

372
00:22:57,130 --> 00:23:04,220
as you deplete the amount
of A, the branching into B

373
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,680
becomes important.

374
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:09,710
And you become second order.

375
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:14,380
So this is second
order at the beginning.

376
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:23,150
And this becomes first order.

377
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,040
So, any questions here?

378
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,600
The importance of
doing this problem

379
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,390
here was to lay out
basically a systematic way

380
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:32,800
of looking at the problem.

381
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:39,080
You lay out your rate equations.

382
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,030
Like this.

383
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:45,230
You solve what you can, in
this case you solve for A.

384
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,360
And it's complicated.

385
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,220
So you want to learn
something about what

386
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,630
the data might look like.

387
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,980
And you look at limiting cases.

388
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,530
Two obvious limiting cases.

389
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,370
One rate is faster
than the other.

390
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:59,110
You pick the first one
first, then go through it.

391
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,860
And then use your intuition.

392
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,830
Every point along the
way, your intuition

393
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,990
can tell you what you
expect the result to be.

394
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:09,690
So in this case
here, our intuition

395
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:13,160
told us that if we
took the rate into B

396
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,326
to be much faster
than that into C,

397
00:24:15,326 --> 00:24:16,700
than we expected
to see something

398
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,430
that was largely first order.

399
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,870
And when you we
the approximation

400
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:23,290
in our exact solution,
in fact it does

401
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:25,330
look like it's first order.

402
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,600
So always use your intuition.

403
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,760
Because the math is going
to get pretty hairy.

404
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,110
The algebra might
make it complicated.

405
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,090
And it's really easy
to make a plus sign

406
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,980
into a minus sign
somewhere along the way.

407
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,810
Just like I did here.

408
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:41,820
So if I hadn't fixed
my mistake here,

409
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:45,219
and I had gone and put
in my Taylor series here,

410
00:24:45,219 --> 00:24:46,510
I would have gotten in trouble.

411
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,468
Because this minus sign
would have been a plus.

412
00:24:48,468 --> 00:24:50,760
And these k2 A0's would
not have canceled out.

413
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,330
And I wouldn't have gotten
the right result, which

414
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:59,230
my intuition had told me should
be a second order process.

415
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:02,920
And so if you have a problem,
let's say you're on an exam

416
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,780
and you're doing algebra,
you're trying to,

417
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,160
and you end up
with a result that

418
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,624
doesn't match what your
intuition tells you,

419
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:10,040
and you don't have
time to fix it.

420
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,700
Tell us.

421
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,517
You know, I know this
is wrong because I

422
00:25:12,517 --> 00:25:14,100
know it's supposed
to be second order.

423
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,880
But I don't know
where I went wrong.

424
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,100
And that's really important.

425
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,320
Just tell us.

426
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,324
That means that you're thinking.

427
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:28,990
Let's get a little
bit more complicated.

428
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:35,670
Any questions?

429
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,790
Consecutive series reactions.

430
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,140
These were parallel
reactions and now.

431
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,750
Basically what
we're doing here is

432
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:47,740
we're building up a toolkit
of simple mechanisms.

433
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,110
And then we'll be able to
put these mechanisms together

434
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,980
to make something
more complicated.

435
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:04,840
So the next kind of mechanism,
series mechanism, series

436
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,280
reactions, so we
have our reaction.

437
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:14,149
Which is A goes to
C. And the mechanism

438
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:15,690
that's been thought
for this reaction

439
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,170
is that there's an intermediate.

440
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:22,090
That first you have A goes to
B, some intermediate, which gets

441
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:27,480
used up to form the final
product, C, with a rate, k2,

442
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,520
here.

443
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,790
And we can either write
the mechanism in two steps.

444
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:41,180
Or we can write it as A goes
to B goes to C, like this.

445
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,067
And see both ways of writing it.

446
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,150
And we want to solve this.

447
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:47,691
And we want to look
at special cases,

448
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:50,390
and we just want to
understand the implications

449
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,230
of this mechanism.

450
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,313
So the first thing to do,
just like we did before,

451
00:26:53,313 --> 00:26:57,970
is to write all the rate laws.

452
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,410
Before we got going
solving anything.

453
00:27:01,410 --> 00:27:05,080
So we start with A, minus dA/dt.

454
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,510
There's only one way
that gets used up.

455
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:11,270
Through the formation of B
in a first order process.

456
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,130
Easy.

457
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,060
This is easy to solve.

458
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:17,970
We know the answer is going
to be exponential in it.

459
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:23,240
For B, dB/dt is
equal to, well it

460
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,680
can be formed through
my first order in A,

461
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,480
so that's k1 times
A. But it also

462
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,000
could get destroyed
by forming C.

463
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,360
So we've got to get
all the paths out

464
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,120
of A, here on the right
side of this equation.

465
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,290
So it can be destroyed
in a process, which

466
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:42,795
is first order in
B. So we're going

467
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:49,537
to take both k1 and k2 to
be first order initially.

468
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,870
Then we'll make one of them
second order and things will

469
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,330
become very complicated and
we'll throw up our hands.

470
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,350
But for now, let's not throw
up our hands quite yet.

471
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:00,480
OK and for dC/dt,
there's only one way

472
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,810
it can be formed is first
order by destroying B.

473
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,070
And we have a couple of
differential equations here.

474
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:16,350
This differential equation
for C, depends on B here.

475
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:21,150
The differential for
B depends on A here.

476
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,650
So that means that things are
going to get a little bit more

477
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,935
complicated.

478
00:28:27,935 --> 00:28:30,060
The easy one to solve is
always the first one here.

479
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,380
That's first order.

480
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,140
So we just write
down the answer.

481
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:38,800
A is equal to A0, e
to the minus k1 t.

482
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,030
We know the answer to that one.

483
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:46,790
Then we have to work
on B. So we want

484
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,010
to find out integrated rate laws
for every one of these chemical

485
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:59,950
species.

486
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,990
And always there
are tricks involved.

487
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,840
Partial fractions, whatever.

488
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,480
So we write down
B now. dB/dt plus,

489
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,170
let me rearrange it a little
bit, plus k2 times B, putting

490
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:14,320
the minus k2 B on
the other side here.

491
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,502
Is equal to k1
times A. But I'm not

492
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:18,210
going to keep this A
there, because now I

493
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,410
know what A is in terms of time.

494
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:28,790
And a constant. k1 times A0
e to the minus k1 times time.

495
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:30,340
OK, that's my
differential equation

496
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:35,370
for B. Got to solve this thing.

497
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,270
Well, the last time I did
differential equations

498
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,610
in college was a century ago.

499
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,250
And I wasn't kidding.

500
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,590
It really was last century.

501
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:46,920
In fact, it was last millennium.

502
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,234
That was a long time ago.

503
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:50,150
So how do you do this?

504
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,940
Well, the trick here,
there's a trick.

505
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,310
And the trick is to multiply the
whole thing, both sides, by e

506
00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,470
to the k2 t.

507
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,510
And you multiply this
side by e to the k2 t

508
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,520
and you multiply this
side by e to the k2 t,

509
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,620
to solve this equation.

510
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,270
So once you do
that, then you have

511
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:22,326
e to the k2 t times dB/dt plus
k2 times B. This side here.

512
00:30:22,326 --> 00:30:30,200
And then you have is equal to
k1 times A0 e to the minus, e

513
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:39,380
to the k2 minus k1 times time.

514
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,515
OK, so the reason
why this trick works

515
00:30:42,515 --> 00:30:47,270
is because this guy right
here can be nicely written

516
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:56,430
as d/dt of B times
e to the k2 t.

517
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,500
It's in nice simple form,
so when you integrate,

518
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,254
it'll be very easy to integrate.

519
00:31:01,254 --> 00:31:02,670
And then the other
side, you still

520
00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:12,350
have k1 A0 e to the k2
minus k1 times the time.

521
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,530
So now you integrate
both sides with respect

522
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,180
to time, The integral of
something d/dt with respect

523
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,690
to time, it's just going
to be itself right here.

524
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,190
So it's very simple.

525
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:24,540
So you integrate both sides
from zero to time, dt.

526
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:31,430
Zero to t, dt on both sides.

527
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:34,480
And on this side here,
you end up with B,

528
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:42,340
e to the k2 times time minus
B, e to the k2 times zero.

529
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,440
Just taking the upper limit
minus the lower limit.

530
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,840
And that's just equal to
B0, at time to equal zero.

531
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,740
And so, and at
time to equal zero,

532
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,870
B0 is equal to zero because we
haven't made any intermediates.

533
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,480
So this goes away.

534
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,410
And then we have an equals sign.

535
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:15,079
And on the other side, we
have k1 A0 over k2 minus k1,

536
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,620
it's just the integral
of this thing,

537
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:21,580
here with a k2 minus k1
goes in the denominator. e

538
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:28,290
to the k2 minus k1
times time minus one.

539
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:33,150
So now you have your integral
form for the amount of B

540
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,820
that gets created at any time.

541
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,980
And I want to keep
that on the board.

542
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,540
Because I'm going
to use it later.

543
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:52,250
k1 A0 over k1 minus k2 times
e to the minus k1 times

544
00:32:52,250 --> 00:33:01,810
time minus e to the
minus k2 times time.

545
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:03,770
OK, we're two thirds
of the way through.

546
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:10,080
Now we've got to find C.
And for the last component,

547
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,290
you don't want to be
doing this kind of stuff.

548
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,830
You don't want to waste your
time solving differential

549
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:20,082
equations, because
stoichiometry can help you out.

550
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:22,040
At the end of the day,
you know that everything

551
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:25,340
that started out as A,
in terms of quantities,

552
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,240
is going to end up at C.
You know that if you end up

553
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,220
with a concentration
A0 at the beginning,

554
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,440
at the end of the process
the concentration of C,

555
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,210
at infinite time, is
also going to be A0.

556
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:41,470
If you know that
there's a correlation,

557
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,130
there's a stoichiometry that
relates A and C together.

558
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:53,200
And B. You have conservation
of mass here, basically.

559
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,430
Conservation of atoms.

560
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,610
That has to come into play

561
00:33:58,610 --> 00:34:07,870
So, for C, we're just going to
do algebra instead of calculus.

562
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:10,620
So let's write down
the stoichiometry here.

563
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:15,370
The amount of C at
any time is what

564
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,200
it's going to be at the end.

565
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,600
Which is A0, very
end of the process.

566
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,240
It's going to be A0.

567
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:24,530
But before we get
to the end, there's

568
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:28,346
still stuff that's
left in A and B.

569
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:30,220
And that's going to
decrease the amount of C.

570
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:35,660
So minus whatever's
still in A and B.

571
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,712
That's the stoichiometry.

572
00:34:37,712 --> 00:34:38,920
That's one way of writing it.

573
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,711
You could also write
it in a different way.

574
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:47,450
Which is that the amount of
C is equal to the amount of A

575
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,240
that you have used up.

576
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,270
A0 is what you started out with.

577
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,350
A is what's left over.

578
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:57,210
So this is the
amount of A used up.

579
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,280
It's not all quite in C yet.

580
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,510
Some of it is stuck in B.

581
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,060
So it's the amount of A used
up, minus the amount that's

582
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,330
stuck in B. Those
two are the same.

583
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,580
I hope.

584
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,220
A0 minus A, yeah, that's right.

585
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,940
Minus B, yeah, that's right.

586
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:18,180
So this is used up.

587
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:26,770
And then stuck in B.
That's the hard part.

588
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:29,080
Putting down the stoichiometry.

589
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:30,710
Once you've done
the hard part, then

590
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,180
if you solve the other
two then it's easy.

591
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:32,888
You just plug in.

592
00:35:32,888 --> 00:35:35,210
It's just algebra.

593
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:37,910
And you get something
complicated.

594
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:43,920
C is equal to complicated.

595
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,110
It's in the notes, I'm not
going to write it down.

596
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,680
So we've solved the
problem exactly.

597
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,389
And now you're going
to do an experiment.

598
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,930
And the experiment
you're going to do

599
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:57,100
is not going to follow
this whole thing, exactly.

600
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,840
It's going to look
at limited cases.

601
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,560
That's what you can do.

602
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,020
And so the first
thing to look at

603
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,140
is to look at the initial times.

604
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,840
The very beginning
of the process,

605
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,180
how are things appearing.

606
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:33,240
And then we'll look
at the late times.

607
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,940
So initial times.

608
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:46,040
Near t equals zero.

609
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:50,780
Well, every one of these things
has an exponential in it.

610
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,470
And whenever we see exponentials
and we look at something

611
00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:57,040
at the early times, times that
are faster than one over k1,

612
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,940
or faster than one over k2, it
tells us use a Taylor series.

613
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,210
So use the approximation
e to the minus kt

614
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:14,510
is approximately equal to
one minus kt plus kt squared

615
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:16,110
over two plus et cetera.

616
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,040
And keep as many terms as
you need in the Taylor series

617
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,640
to get something sensible.

618
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,610
So if everything comes
out of zero at the end,

619
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,210
you know you haven't
kept enough terms in t.

620
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:28,110
Things have canceled
out too much.

621
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:31,010
And you want something
that is time dependent.

622
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:33,210
Because you've got a
change in time, right?

623
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,330
It's a very common mistake
to say only keep one here

624
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:38,680
and then everything
cancels out you get zero,

625
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,940
and you say, well, B is
equal to zero at all times.

626
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:46,390
That's nonsensical.

627
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,330
And I don't know a priori
how much time to keep.

628
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:53,340
So let's go to second order.

629
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:00,150
So if you plug this
Taylor series into A,

630
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,230
and get something
that's time dependent,

631
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,070
you only need to
go to first order.

632
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:08,850
One minus k1 times
time plus et cetera.

633
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:14,000
Plug it into b, plug your
Taylor series into these two

634
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:22,450
guys here, get k1
A0 over k2 minus k1,

635
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,640
you only need it to
go to first order.

636
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,720
The one's cancel out but
the times don't cancel out.

637
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,160
Minus k1 plus k2, that is,
unless k1 and k2 are the same.

638
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,130
So we're making
the approximation

639
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,930
that k1 is different than k2.

640
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:41,430
Times the time.

641
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,780
And when we look at C,
this complicated thing

642
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:46,680
that I didn't write
down, if you were just

643
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,832
to stop at first order in
C, you get C equals zero.

644
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:52,040
You know that can't be right.

645
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,036
You know that C is going
to increase in time.

646
00:38:55,036 --> 00:38:56,660
It can't be equal to
zero at all times.

647
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,950
So we have to go to
second order for C0.

648
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:08,560
And it's approximately equal to
A0 times k1 k2 over two times

649
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,459
the time squared.

650
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:13,250
Let me rewrite this a
little bit closer in,

651
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,450
because I need some room here.

652
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:20,540
So c is approximately
equal to A0 k1

653
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,807
is k2 over two
times time squared.

654
00:39:24,807 --> 00:39:26,390
OK, and then we can
start plotting out

655
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:27,931
what this is going
to look like then.

656
00:39:27,931 --> 00:39:30,960
So we have the concentrations
time on the axis here.

657
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:34,305
Let's start with the
concentrating of A. A

658
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:38,200
is dropping down
linearly in time.

659
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:41,850
It's dropping down
linearly in time here.

660
00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:46,590
B is increasing linearly
in time, at the beginning.

661
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:51,190
So B is going up linearly
in time, like this.

662
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:55,210
And C is increasing
quadratically in time.

663
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,120
So it's pretty flat,
coming up first.

664
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:03,150
And then it starts to curve up.

665
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,070
It's our first approximation.

666
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,494
Then, we go to late
times. t equals infinity.

667
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,660
So t equals infinity where
am I going to write this?

668
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:33,010
Have to move this up.

669
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:35,620
Let's go, t goes to infinity.

670
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:38,160
Well, here I know that
I'm allowed to go to zero.

671
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,560
Or allowed to go to constant,
because infinity is forever.

672
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,180
So at t infinity, I know that
I'm going to use up all of A.

673
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,620
So I know that A is
going to be equal to 0.

674
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,820
I know I'm going
to use up all of B.

675
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,670
So I know B is
going to go to zero.

676
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,920
Somehow.

677
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,950
And I know that C is
going to go to A0.

678
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:07,840
So C is going to go
to A0 at infinity.

679
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:17,390
So now on my graph here,
I know that at infinity, A

680
00:41:17,390 --> 00:41:20,850
is going to go down to
zero like this, somehow.

681
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,960
Probably exponentially, because
it is exponential in time.

682
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,710
So it's going to go
to zero exponentially.

683
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:27,630
B is going to go down
to zero exponentially.

684
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,070
There are the
exponentials right here.

685
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:33,580
So B is going to go down
to zero exponentially.

686
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,500
Something like this.

687
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,160
And C is going to
saturate to A0.

688
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,770
Exponentially rise up to A0.

689
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:42,510
So this was A0 right here.

690
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,730
It's going to go like this.

691
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,160
So then I connect the dots.

692
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,810
And I know that C is going
to start quadratically.

693
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,550
And then it's going to rise
up an exponent like this.

694
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:57,220
I know that B is going
to start off linearly,

695
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,470
and then it has to go to zero.

696
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:03,030
So it has to go through
some sort of maximum.

697
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:08,120
And A is going to go
down exponentially,

698
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,640
exponentially like this.

699
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,550
So the interesting
part of this diagram

700
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:13,870
is that B goes to a maximum.

701
00:42:13,870 --> 00:42:20,680
There is some point,
there's some time,

702
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,870
that we can call t sub B
max, where B is a maxima.

703
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:27,570
And that's an interesting point.

704
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:30,250
That's something that we can
try to figure out experimentally

705
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:31,710
what it is.

706
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:33,990
And we could get
some parameters,

707
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:36,810
we could maybe extract
some information.

708
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:42,470
There's a maximum B,
concentration of B,

709
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,190
that gets formed.

710
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:47,860
And how do you solve that?

711
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:52,590
You set dB/dt equal to zero.

712
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:55,510
So you have your equation
for B right here.

713
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,820
You set it equal to
zero. and you solve.

714
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,290
You get your maximum time.

715
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:02,390
It's made up of rate constant.

716
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,190
You get your maximum
concentration,

717
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,120
which is also made
up of rate constants.

718
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,791
And you can get rate
constants out of this.

719
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:10,290
Question.

720
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:16,555
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

721
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:17,180
PROFESSOR: Yes.

722
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:22,705
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

723
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:24,080
PROFESSOR: That
is a coincidence.

724
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:31,380
That is my poor sketching.

725
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:37,870
It should probably be somewhere
like, in the middle here.

726
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,359
Actually, it completely
depends on the rates.

727
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:42,900
And we're going to
see limiting cases

728
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:45,970
where this maximum
can occur here,

729
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:51,860
or it can occur
somewhere down here.

730
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:57,610
So this is the complete case.

731
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:04,772
So, limiting cases. the
important limiting cases.

732
00:44:04,772 --> 00:44:06,480
We've made an
approximation along the way

733
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,688
that k1 is different than k2.

734
00:44:07,688 --> 00:44:10,950
So that has to be a case
that needs to be worked out.

735
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:17,690
And it's likely to be easier
than the full solution.

736
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:22,300
So one of the limiting
cases is k1 is equal to k2

737
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,180
and I'll leave
that for homework.

738
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:31,010
You can do that yourselves.

739
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,255
It's good exercise.

740
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,630
What about another
limiting case?

741
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,740
Well, you have two
other limiting cases.

742
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:39,140
One, you've got two rates.

743
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:45,540
So, one is bigger
than the other.

744
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:50,980
No information on
this board here.

745
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:54,550
You start off with one case.

746
00:44:54,550 --> 00:45:03,050
So k1 greater than k2.
k1 greater than k2.

747
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:05,840
What does it mean?
k1 greater than k2.

748
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,360
It means that the
rate determining

749
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,320
step, or the limiting
step, in this reaction,

750
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:16,330
is the second step. k2 is
very slow compared to k1.

751
00:45:16,330 --> 00:45:21,850
And sometimes I like to think
of these things as pipes.

752
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:25,460
And connecting vessels.

753
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,490
So let's say we have
the amount of liquid

754
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:32,530
in the top vessel is
the concentration of A.

755
00:45:32,530 --> 00:45:34,870
The amount of liquid
in the middle vessel,

756
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:45,972
let me get my color scheme
to be consistent here.

757
00:45:45,972 --> 00:45:47,430
Then we have a
middle vessel, which

758
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,380
is the concentration of B,
and a final vessel, which

759
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,650
is the concentration
of C. And we start out

760
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:59,250
with some sort of
amount of A in here.

761
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:02,940
Started with a lot of A,
and then these vessels

762
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:04,910
are connecting with pipes.

763
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:07,150
So there's a very
thick, big pipe

764
00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:11,050
that connects A and B together.

765
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:16,430
The rate is fast,
going from A to B.

766
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,780
And the rate going
from B to C is slow,

767
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:26,930
so there's a skinny pipe
connecting B and C together.

768
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:29,080
Then I turn on the
system, I set time

769
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,680
to equal zero,
poof, what happens?

770
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,360
There's the big pipe
connecting A and B.

771
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:37,050
The whole amount of a here gets
transferred to B, suddenly.

772
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:38,090
Then it gets stuck here.

773
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,830
And then it dribbles
out from B to C.

774
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:44,050
So what do we expect,
if we were to plot

775
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:49,100
our quantities as
a function of time.

776
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,820
What we'd expect
then, then we're

777
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,470
going to make sure that
the math works out,

778
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:58,350
is that A is going to
decrease really fast.

779
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,050
It's going to go, poof.

780
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:08,770
First order in time
with a very fast rate.

781
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,680
And all of this is going
to go straight into B.

782
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:13,305
So we expect B to go linearly.

783
00:47:13,305 --> 00:47:14,930
Remember, at the
beginning it's linear.

784
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:17,040
Linear goes up.

785
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,420
Almost all the way up to A0.

786
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,400
Because it can't hardly get out.

787
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,770
Reaches its maximum,
then it goes from B to C

788
00:47:26,770 --> 00:47:28,590
through this
skinny, skinny pipe.

789
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:31,540
First order rate,
with a rate k2,

790
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:35,970
so we're exponentially going
down, slowly, slowly, slowly,

791
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,800
with a rate k2.

792
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:44,280
And then C starts quadratically.

793
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,370
And then very quickly,
once everything's into B,

794
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,880
A is forgotten.

795
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,540
A doesn't matter any more.

796
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:54,305
Basically what you're
looking at is a transfer of B

797
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:56,810
into C through this little pipe.

798
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,100
And you know that's going
to be a first order of rate.

799
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,040
First order of process,
B to C's first order

800
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,690
of process with rate k2.

801
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:05,830
So you expect, then, C to
go up in the first order

802
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:13,490
process to A0 with rate k2.

803
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:18,450
There's the rate k2 here.

804
00:48:18,450 --> 00:48:22,650
And the rate k1 here.

805
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,230
So when you turn the crank on
your approximation in the math,

806
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:31,050
what you'd better see
is that at the end,

807
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,890
B as a function of
time should look

808
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,400
like a first order
process with rate k2.

809
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,730
C as a function of time
should look like a first order

810
00:48:38,730 --> 00:48:41,220
process with rate
k2, going to A0.

811
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,180
And you can write
the answer, you

812
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,320
should be able to
write the answer,

813
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,930
for C, it's going to
be C is approximately,

814
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,890
it's going to go to A0,
there's no other choice.

815
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:56,852
Everything that was in A gets
transferred to B0, so at time

816
00:48:56,852 --> 00:48:58,560
is infinity it's going
to be A0, and it's

817
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,120
going to be a first order
process with rate k2.

818
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,100
One minus e to the
minus k2 times times.

819
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,830
I don't even have
to do the math.

820
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,580
I know that's the answer.

821
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,420
If you don't believe
me, then do the math.

822
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,034
You should do it.

823
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:16,950
But that's the answer.

824
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:18,990
It has to be the answer.

825
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:24,950
And if you look at
B, the answer has

826
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:31,640
to be that it's approximately
looking like B is disappearing

827
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,760
with a rate constant that's
k2, e to the minus k2,

828
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,550
and the maximum here
is very close to A0.

829
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:41,400
So I'm going to be
putting A0 here.

830
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:44,040
Close enough.

831
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:47,270
So as long as I ignore the
very initial time where

832
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:50,580
A suddenly dumps into B, then
everything after that very

833
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,220
early time here is just
looking like B goes to C.

834
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,340
This is not zero, this is t.

835
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,960
And A just disappears quickly.

836
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,340
And we can write it as A is
equal to A0 e to the minus

837
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:09,530
k1 times the time.

838
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:12,960
That's an easy approximation.

839
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,360
And you've just got to
make sure that this fits.

840
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:22,320
So the other limiting
case, which I'm also

841
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,070
going to leave as a
homework, because it's

842
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:30,610
so straightforward, is to
have k2 greater than k1,

843
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:34,240
and you should make sure
that you can predict it.

844
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,170
and that the math works out.

845
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:39,660
OK, any questions?

846
00:50:39,660 --> 00:50:42,420
Next time we'll do
reversible reactions.

847
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:46,010
And some more approximations.
