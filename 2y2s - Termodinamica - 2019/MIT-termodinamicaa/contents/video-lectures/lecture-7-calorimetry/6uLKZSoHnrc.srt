8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:25,720
PROFESSOR NELSON: Well, so last
time we did a little bit

9
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,810
more work on thermodynamic
cycles, and basically went

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,420
around a cycle and looked at
some state functions, delta u

11
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,910
and delta H. Saw that around
a closed cycle those zero

12
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:35,940
because they're state
functions.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,530
So if you start and end at the
same place, they've got end at

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,860
the same place that
they started.

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,870
There's no change in them, and
then we also looked at some at

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,020
non-state functions, work and
heat, and saw that those

17
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,720
aren't zero going
around a cycle.

18
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:53,030
Of course you can do work in a
cyclic process, and heat can

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,200
be exchanged with the
environment at the same time.

20
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,040
So we calculated those
values too.

21
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,770
And we also looked at this other
funny function that's

22
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,590
our special function.

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:10,070
We looked at this integral dq
over T. It's so special that

24
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:14,170
we called this derivative dS,
and saw that at least for the

25
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,960
cycle we looked at, it
also behaved as a

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,840
state function behaves.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,120
That is, going around the cycle,
it had no net change,

28
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,210
and we'll see this come
back later on.

29
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,540
Then we went on to look at
thermochemistry, and that's

30
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,220
what I want to continue today.

31
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:44,020
So really, the main result that
we saw last time is that

32
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:52,990
we can describe the enthalpy
of reaction, so if we have

33
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:04,750
reactants going to products, and
we'd like to know our heat

34
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,800
of reaction or enthalpy of
reaction, remember it's a

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,540
constant pressure as we're
considering it, so it's

36
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,690
equivalent to heat of reaction,
than the way we can

37
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,840
do this is construct a cycle
where we're going to express

38
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,230
these in terms of their
constituent elements.

39
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:25,810
We're going to all the way
back to the atoms.

40
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,430
Right, so if we have the
elements in their standard

41
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,310
states, that is their most
stable forms at room

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:46,600
temperature and pressure, then
what we're really doing is

43
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,900
we're saying let's take the
reactants and let's pull them

44
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,110
all apart into their
separate elements,

45
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,490
they're separate atoms.

46
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,200
And then put them back together
this way, and we'll

47
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,440
calculate the enthalpy
of this process, the

48
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,670
enthalpy of this process.

49
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,090
It's a cycle, so that'll
give us the enthalpy of

50
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,300
reaction, all right?

51
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:16,390
So this delta H is our sum for
delta H of formation for the

52
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,440
reactants, right.

53
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:25,580
And this is our sum of
the quantity for

54
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,350
the products, right.

55
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,850
And in this way, then we can
express our delta H of

56
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:43,970
reaction is just going to be
given a sum of the heats of

57
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,140
formation or the difference
between the heats of formation

58
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,320
of the products and the
reactants, right?

59
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,210
Now, of course, we have to
weight this by the number of

60
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,330
moles of each reactant
to each product

61
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,840
involved in the reaction.

62
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,720
So to write this a little more
carefully, it's, you want to

63
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:09,700
write the sum over i of nu i
delta H naught of formation of

64
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:17,200
i summed over the products.

65
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:25,040
This is per mole minus sum over
i, nu i here over the

66
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,940
reactants in the
same quantity.

67
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,070
Delta H per mole f i, right?

68
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,830
So in other words, were taking
each of the products and we're

69
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:40,470
going to weight them by their
stoichiomeric coefficients,

70
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,660
and we're going to have in this
delta H of reaction their

71
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,490
heats of formation, and then
we're going to have the

72
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,950
negative heats of formation of
the reactants, because that's

73
00:04:50,950 --> 00:05:07,950
being subtracted, okay?

74
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:11,320
So, just to go through a basic
example, let's just look at

75
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,240
the burning of methane.

76
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:26,440
So we've got methane gas,
combining with oxygen gas, so

77
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:36,070
you have carbon dioxide gas and
liquid water, and we'll

78
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:40,260
consider the whole thing
at room temperature

79
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,810
and pressure, right.

80
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,690
So let's just undertake
this set of processes.

81
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,460
Let's decompose these
to the elements.

82
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,820
So in other words, our methane
gas, we're going to write the

83
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,540
chemical equilibrium between
this and the solid carbon.

84
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,890
That is to say let's specify
graphite, it's not diamond,

85
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,390
right, graphite is the stable
form of carbon at room

86
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:15,260
temperature and pressure.

87
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:22,460
And then, hydrogen gas two
moles of hydrogen gas and

88
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:27,100
we're going to have a delta
H of formation.

89
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:34,000
This is for CH4 in the
gas phase, right?

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:46,990
And then over here, we have our
oxygen but 2 O2 gas going

91
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:53,840
to, well 2 O2 gas -- the point
is oxygen already is in it's

92
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,820
stable form at room temperature

93
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,760
and pressure, right?

94
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,500
That is the elemental form of
oxygen, of course, is as

95
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:08,770
oxygen molecules in the gas so
there's no delta H formation

96
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:12,200
for oxygen.

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,260
The gas is zero, right.

98
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:20,160
And then second phase of this,
now we're going to take the

99
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,810
elements that we've produced,
and we're going to put them

100
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,320
back to make products, right?

101
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:36,380
So there we've got carbon as
graphite, and a solid plus an

102
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:43,600
oxygen gas goes to make
CO2 gas, right.

103
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,450
And we've got our positive
delta H of formation

104
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:52,140
associated with that.

105
00:07:52,140 --> 00:08:03,580
And finally we've got hydrogen
gas plus oxygen gas giving us

106
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:08,180
two water molecules and this
is in the liquid phase, and

107
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,140
there's some delta heat of
formation associated with

108
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:19,260
that, okay.

109
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:23,030
So there is our set of
individual processes that's

110
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:25,690
going to constitute
our cycle, right.

111
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:29,150
If we take the combination of
all those, which is to say we

112
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:33,910
just take both steps in this
cycle, then we'll have our net

113
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,790
reaction, which is to say
we'll have this, right.

114
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:43,890
So what that says is our heat
of reaction is our heat of

115
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:53,340
formation per mole of
CO2 gas, right.

116
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,410
Plus 2 times the heat of
reaction or heat of formation

117
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:14,790
per mole of liquid water minus
heat of formation per mole of

118
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,880
methane, right.

119
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,430
And things we can
easily look up.

120
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,220
So in a simple way, we can
determine, we can calculate

121
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,520
what the heat of
reaction is for

122
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,530
something like this, right.

123
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:32,900
And you'll see in the back
of your book, you'll see

124
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,260
moderately extensive tables of
heats of formation, and if you

125
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:39,690
go online you'll see, you can
find extremely extensive

126
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,840
tabulated values of heats of
formation, that have been

127
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:45,160
measured for an enormous
number of compounds.

128
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,510
And from that, then you can look
at enthalpies of reaction

129
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:52,050
for countless numbers
of reactions, right.

130
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,140
So by using the tabulated data,
we can really determined

131
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,970
heats of formation for most
reactions that you might

132
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:04,070
contemplate, OK?

133
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:09,500
Of course, the cyclic steps that
we've taken to do this

134
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,580
apply not just for breaking
down reactants and product

135
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
into the elements in their
standards states, but of

136
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,600
course we could also look at
whole sets of reactions and

137
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,580
write cycles as well, right.

138
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,900
So for example, if we wanted
to look at the reaction of

139
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:38,190
something like carbon graphite
plus oxygen gas to make carbon

140
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,620
monoxide gas, well normally
this isn't the way the

141
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,700
reaction would work.

142
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:46,810
Normally if you just tried to
make this happen what you

143
00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:52,580
would wind up with the
CO2, not CO, right.

144
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,860
But one way to approach this
is you could look at the

145
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,710
individual reactions of going,
you could go to CO2 and then

146
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:05,240
you can go with CO2 and oxygen
and combine, or combine CO and

147
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,630
oxygen to get CO2, right?

148
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:17,630
So normally, CO2 is formed, but
you could calculate the

149
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:18,330
heat of reaction.

150
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,470
Of course you could go back to
the elements, but you can also

151
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,080
say well, let's just take a
known heat of reaction for, or

152
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:29,390
heat of formation for CO2, and
then also combine that with

153
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,890
the heat of reaction for CO plus
oxygen forming CO2 and

154
00:11:33,890 --> 00:12:04,640
determine this that way, all
right, OK, so once you have

155
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,860
done this, once we've got the
heat of reaction then there

156
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,050
are a few simple results
that are useful.

157
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:13,370
One is we know immediately
whether when we run a reaction

158
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,890
heat is going to be released
in the process out to the

159
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,660
environment, or whether
heat is going to

160
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,950
be taken in, right.

161
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:24,220
So, and of course if you ever
used a hot pack or a chemical

162
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,180
hot pack or cold pack, you've
seen examples of the two of

163
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,250
those, where the constituents
are selected to give you

164
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,850
either heat released or
heat taken up, right.

165
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:42,930
So in particular delta H of
reaction less than zero, that

166
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:47,580
means a negative amount of heat,
which means that heat is

167
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:56,270
released, right.

168
00:12:56,270 --> 00:13:08,230
Yes, that is it's exothermic.

169
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,720
Positive enthalpy of reaction,
which is to say a heat of

170
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,270
reaction is positive.

171
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,630
Remember the way we define heat
is positive it means that

172
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:22,540
there is heat that is coming
from the environment into the

173
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,320
system, right.

174
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,010
In other words heat is absorbed
or taken up by the

175
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:39,870
reacting system.

176
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:47,320
That's endothermic, okay.

177
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:53,200
All right, one more important
aspect of this that we need to

178
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,670
be able to deal with, and that
is the heats of formation that

179
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,350
you'll find tabulated typically
are going to be

180
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:02,210
given for room temperature
and pressure.

181
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,080
And it's very common that you
might want to know the

182
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:07,480
thermodynamic condition for
reactions, especially at other

183
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,750
temperatures, very common,
of course.

184
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,960
And it's not hard to see how the
heat of reaction at room

185
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:19,420
temperature can be related to
they heat of reaction at other

186
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,470
temperatures.

187
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:31,830
So let's just look at that.

188
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:38,700
So remember your fundamental
relation, dH, if you write

189
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,460
that as a function of
temperature and pressure,

190
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:48,990
partial of H with respect to T,
constant pressure, dT, plus

191
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:54,850
partial of H with respect to p
at constant temperature, dp.

192
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:56,690
But if we're working
at constant

193
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:02,750
pressure then dp is zero.

194
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:06,680
So we just got the derivative
with respect to temperature.

195
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:14,890
That's our heat capacity,
right, Cp.

196
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:18,880
And we may have tabulated values
of Cp for an enormous

197
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,240
number of materials.

198
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:27,530
So now, if we look at the
temperature dependence of

199
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:31,240
delta H for reaction, really
what we're going to need to do

200
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,540
is look at how that heat
capacity changes going from

201
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,850
reactants to products, right?

202
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:45,320
So in other words, d delta H of
reaction, with respect to

203
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,630
temperature.

204
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:46,860
That's what we want to
find out, right?

205
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,830
So how does delta H change if
we change the temperature?

206
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:59,730
Well, it's just given by Cp dT
for the reactants and the

207
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,490
products, right?

208
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:04,680
For the products minus the
reaction, that is it's delta

209
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:15,350
Cp, we need the sum
over the products.

210
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:26,940
Nu i, Cp i minus same
sum over reactants,

211
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:33,920
i, nu i Cp i, right.

212
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,000
Similar to what we saw before.

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:44,840
Now we need to integrate,
right.

214
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,730
So if we integrate between some
pair of temperatures, T1

215
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:56,470
and T2, we do this and we have
this quantity, d delta H of

216
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,870
reaction with respect to
temperature, dT, all this is

217
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,950
at constant pressure, right.

218
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:11,300
Let's just be careful
to specify that.

219
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:21,710
Well, so of course, this is then
just delta H of reaction

220
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:27,430
at T2 minus delta H
of reaction at T1.

221
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,380
This is looking good.

222
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,890
This is what we want to get,
is our heat of reaction at

223
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:33,020
some new temperature T2.

224
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,900
If we already know it at some
initial temperature, usually

225
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,150
room temperature, T1.

226
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,720
And it's just given by the
integral from T1 to T2 of

227
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,510
delta Cp dT.

228
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:55,400
Now in general, this is as far
as we can go, but at least if

229
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:59,810
the temperature change isn't
too big, for most materials

230
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,850
that heat capacities doesn't
depend very strongly on

231
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,920
temperature, right.

232
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,270
If you take some material, and
you measure its heat capacity,

233
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:10,510
right, how much heat do I have
to put into it in order to

234
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,490
change its temperature
by a degree, right.

235
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,120
And I make that measurement
at room temperature.

236
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,530
And then maybe I raise the
temperature to whatever, room

237
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:23,780
temperature, maybe 20 degrees
hotter than room temperature.

238
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:27,290
And I again say OK, now how much
heat do I need to raise

239
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,170
this thing's temperature
by 1 degree?

240
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:33,350
The amount of heat I need to put
in to do that is not very

241
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,210
different from what it was at
room temperature right.

242
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,300
In other words the
heat capacity

243
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,780
didn't change very much.

244
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:45,340
So, the result of that is
that at least for modest

245
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,250
temperature excursions, it may
be the case that we can

246
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,470
simplify this and simply say
it's just the difference in

247
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:56,870
heat capacities times the
temperature change.

248
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,550
Again, we can't always be
assured of that, but it's

249
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,940
often the case.

250
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:14,930
Any questions on any
of this so far?

251
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,030
OK, now what I want to do is
just describe a little bit of

252
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,070
how do you measure all
this stuff, right?

253
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,030
So what we've done so far is
just lay out in principle how

254
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,360
we should describe heats of
reaction, and of course

255
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,340
assuming that we've got
everything in tables we can

256
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,090
always look them up, but
sometimes you want to make new

257
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:36,740
compounds, right.

258
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,400
Sometimes you'd like to know
what the energetics are

259
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,725
involved there, right, and so
it's useful to be able to

260
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:46,710
actually measure something.

261
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:48,130
So how do we do It?

262
00:19:48,130 --> 00:20:15,390
This is what's called
calorimetry.

263
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:26,040
So we're going to make
measurements to determine heat

264
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,950
of reaction values.

265
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,130
Actually, calorimetry is used
for all sorts of things.

266
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:34,340
It can be used to determine, for
example, the energetics of

267
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,340
phase transitions.

268
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,370
Maybe you're not looking at a
reaction, but you've got some

269
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:40,280
new compound, and you're looking
at it go from liquid

270
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,140
to solid or to gas.

271
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:45,330
And you can see what the heat
involved in a process like

272
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:48,080
that is as well.

273
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,000
So what happens?

274
00:20:50,000 --> 00:21:01,280
Well, the objective in the case
of a reaction, we have

275
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:09,210
reactants at some temperature
going to products at that

276
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:14,010
temperature, and that is our
heat of reaction at that

277
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,390
temperature.

278
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,480
That's how it's defined,
right, at constant

279
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,940
temperature.

280
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,640
OK?

281
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,720
What do we actually measure?

282
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,150
Well, what we can really do is
we can put the reactants in

283
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:37,270
some container, put the whole
thing in an insulated place,

284
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,310
you know, hold things in
a big insulated box.

285
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,190
Run the reaction.

286
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,620
Maybe it produces heat.

287
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,810
If it does, then the whole thing
will heat up, right?

288
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:52,290
The stuff that's inside the
reacting volume, and

289
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,445
whatever's right around it there
inside the big box, it's

290
00:21:55,445 --> 00:21:56,990
all going to heat up.

291
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,600
So I'll start at some initial
temperature, T1.

292
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,170
I won't end up at the
same temperature.

293
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,570
It'll be hotter.

294
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:03,480
How much hotter?

295
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,740
Well, that depends on how
much heat was produced.

296
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,640
So in principle, if I measure
how much hotter, I can

297
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,430
determine how much heat was
produced, and from that, I

298
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,670
should be able to calculate
delta H at T1.

299
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:24,950
So let's think about how
that's really working.

300
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:35,640
I've really got reactants at T1,
plus a calorimeter at T1,

301
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,650
and I'm going to end up with
products -- well let's let me

302
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:46,140
just write that's over.

303
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,260
In fact, let's start by just
putting a little sketch of the

304
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,430
whole thing up.

305
00:22:50,430 --> 00:23:00,750
So here's my reacting stuff,
maybe it's a liquid.

306
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,440
It's going to take
place in there.

307
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,410
It's going to be a constant
pressure, it might be open to

308
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,960
the air, or even if it isn't,
there might be plenty of room,

309
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,280
and it's a liquid anyway, so
the pressure isn't going to

310
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,380
change significantly.

311
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:18,490
I want to measure
the temperature.

312
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:23,520
And the whole thing is
insulated right.

313
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,300
I don't want to have to deal
with heat escaping to the

314
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,920
outside environment in a way
that might be difficult or

315
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,190
complicated to measure
or calculate.

316
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,640
OK, so this, what I've sketched
here would be a

317
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
constant pressure calorimeter.

318
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,360
There's a reaction.

319
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,600
Normally this is used for a
reaction in the condensed

320
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,300
phases and liquid usually.

321
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:58,620
So this is a constant pressure
calorimeter.

322
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,020
It's set up to be

323
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:03,320
well-insulated so it's adiabatic.

324
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,580
That's the set up.

325
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,750
We're going to run the
reactants, the reaction.

326
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,860
The reactants are going
to turn into products.

327
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:31,420
Let's look at what happens.

328
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:41,270
So what happens is my
reactants at T1 plus

329
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:52,460
calorimeter at T1 turn into
products at T2 plus my

330
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,030
calorimeter at T2, right.

331
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:57,980
That's my process.

332
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,180
That's what really happens.

333
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,470
Now that, the enthalpy of that
process isn't what I want,

334
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,110
right, because the temperature
has changed, also the

335
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:09,360
calorimeter is heated up.

336
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,850
So I need to relate this
to what I do want.

337
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,520
Let's label this one.

338
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,600
It is adiabatic.

339
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,790
It is taking place inside this
thing, and it's a constant

340
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,420
pressure, and we'll do
it reversibly, right.

341
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,850
So that's what we've got.

342
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:39,010
Now, we can always take these
things the products and the

343
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,040
calorimeter at temperature T2
and cool them or warm them to

344
00:25:43,040 --> 00:26:07,480
get to products plus calorimeter
at T1, right.

345
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,620
Let's label that two.

346
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,650
It's still at constant
pressure.

347
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,090
It's reversible.

348
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:19,650
It's a temperature change.

349
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,100
Now to make that happen, it's
not adiabatic, right.

350
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,750
If I wanted to do that, I'd
need a heating element or

351
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:28,370
something to cool, so I could
make that temperature change

352
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,870
happen, right.

353
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:33,980
Well, so now I can complete
the cycle.

354
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,490
I've got reactants and
calorimeter at T1.

355
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,770
Fewer products and calorimeter
at T1, right.

356
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:44,260
Calorimeter doesn't change
in this process.

357
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:51,380
So here I've got some delta H
associated with changing the

358
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,360
temperature.

359
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,690
This delta H though, this
is what I want.

360
00:26:55,690 --> 00:27:02,000
This is delta H of reaction
at T1, right?

361
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,370
It's isothermal, constant
pressure, reversible.

362
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,370
Just what I want.

363
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,880
That's how I've defined
delta H of reaction.

364
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,410
This is what I'm after.

365
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:24,050
All right, so now let's see how
we execute it, and do the

366
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:26,690
calculations that allow
us to calculate this.

367
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:43,840
So, one, what's delta
H in step one?

368
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,790
Yes, exactly, it's adiabatic,
right constant pressure.

369
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:51,800
it's zero.

370
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:58,980
Delta H1 is zero, right.

371
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,940
What we're really going to do in
practice is we're going to

372
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,610
measure, we're going to use our
thermometer and say great,

373
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:09,750
how much did the temperature
change, right.

374
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:13,350
So now, then we're going to use
what we're going to learn

375
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,840
from step two in order to
calculate this part, what we

376
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,840
could call step three.

377
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:29,040
OK, so two, that's
the crucial part.

378
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,370
It's constant pressure.

379
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:34,730
It's just given by the
corresponding heat, and it's

380
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:36,640
just a temperature
change, right.

381
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:46,440
So we know how to do this,
integral from well it's T1 to

382
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,530
T2, depending on which way
we go of Cp for the

383
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,470
whole system dT.

384
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:05,590
OK?

385
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:09,050
It's just how much heat is
involved when we change the

386
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:09,450
temperature.

387
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:13,370
Now, the products have some heat
capacity associated with

388
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:16,750
them right, it takes a certain
amount of heat if we make

389
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:19,060
their temperature change, to
either put it in or take it

390
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,030
away, depending on which
direction the

391
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,070
temperature is changing.

392
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:29,050
Same with the calorimeter, OK.

393
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:33,050
In actual practice though, the
calorimeter, is going to be

394
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,910
this big hunk of metal, and
really what's going to,

395
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,610
there's going to be some stuff
in here, right, they'll be a

396
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:42,390
fluid, it will usually
be some sort of oil.

397
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:46,340
There's a pretty big
thermal mass.

398
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,260
Now we run the reaction
and it produces heat.

399
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:55,310
Most of the heat is going to
warm up or cool off all that

400
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,200
oil and stuff.

401
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,390
There's a moderate amount
of material

402
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,570
in the actual reaction.

403
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,180
You want to design the
calorimeter to fulfill that

404
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,100
condition,

405
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,560
Of course, you can't make it
so enormous that even for,

406
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,310
that for any ordinary reaction
there's not even a measurable

407
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,310
temperature change, right,
because if you have your

408
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,860
enough oil to fill up this room,
it would take a huge

409
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,340
amount of heat to change it by
even a tiny, it's temperature

410
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:19,900
but even a tiny amount.

411
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:25,200
So the calorimeter is designed
sort of to scale to match the

412
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,490
maybe the ordinary volume of
reactants that you'll put in

413
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:34,950
there, such that, pretty much
all the heat's just going to

414
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:39,430
heat up the calorimeter, and
there's only a small amount

415
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,510
that's going toward heating
up the products, right.

416
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:49,510
So in general, or at least
usually it'll be the case,

417
00:30:49,510 --> 00:31:01,450
that this is approximately equal
to integral from T1 to

418
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:09,180
T2 Cp of just the
calorimeter dT.

419
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,100
And that generally is just given
by the heat capacity the

420
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,220
calorimeter times
delta T, right..

421
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,620
Because the heat capacity of the
calorimeter just like this

422
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,170
thing is not strongly
temperature dependent, OK.

423
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:44,950
So the point is we can calculate
delta H associated

424
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:52,280
with this process pretty
readily, OK.

425
00:31:52,280 --> 00:32:00,700
That leaves three, right.

426
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:07,400
But delta H for step three must
just be the opposite of

427
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,930
this delta H because this was
zero and we know that were

428
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:23,910
going around a cycle, right.

429
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:28,750
And that's our heat
of reaction.

430
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:44,010
So we're going to be able
to do this, right?

431
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:50,120
OK, now this is one way to
do calorimetry, and it's

432
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,480
practical as long as all the
materials are in condensed

433
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,630
phases, solids and liquids.

434
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,700
If gases are involved it can
work, but it can be tricky to

435
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:06,070
keep the pressure constant,
right, because that means that

436
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,290
now the moles of gas might be
changing, and that means in

437
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,670
some way the volume has
to be adjustable.

438
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,760
You'd need some sort of balloon
or membrane that will

439
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,910
allow that to happen.

440
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:20,760
Could be done, but easier is to
just do the whole thing at

441
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,010
constant volume, right, and just
run the reaction that way

442
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:29,550
and redo the calculation to be
a constant volume rather than

443
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:32,200
constant pressure calorimeter,
right.

444
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,950
And it's not hard to do that.

445
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:37,240
So let's just look at what
happens in that case.

446
00:33:37,240 --> 00:34:02,150
It's almost the same.

447
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,700
So let's see, just to finish the
job here though, all this

448
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,700
says is delta H of reaction is
just negative Cp for the

449
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:18,880
calorimeter times delta T, all
right. so that's what we think

450
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:29,780
we know in constant pressure
calorimetry.

451
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:37,990
Yes, and if we have gases
involved, it's pretty similar,

452
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:41,910
but now what will have is
something like this.

453
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:46,300
We'll have a reaction vessel
that's sealed,

454
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:51,280
it's constant volume.

455
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,470
That'll be inside
our calorimeter.

456
00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:06,900
It's insulated, and there's
still a thermometer, so we can

457
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,170
measure the temperature.

458
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,290
So this is still adiabatic.

459
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:17,100
It's insulated, but now it's
constant volume, OK.

460
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,060
Now, you know with constant
volume, now it's not going to

461
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,880
be delta H that's
straightforward to measure,

462
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,580
it's going to be dealt
u, all right.

463
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:30,820
But it's going to be almost
the same, right?

464
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,900
So let's just think about
what happens here.

465
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,480
Now it's the cycle that
we've got will still

466
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,780
basically look the same.

467
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:44,980
That is its reactants at T1 plus
calorimeter at T1, going

468
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:54,310
to products at T2 plus
calorimeter at T2, right?

469
00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:04,560
And it's still adiabatic, but
now it's constant volume.

470
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,690
And it's also reversal right.

471
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:14,990
So this is our process one.

472
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:21,450
Now, process two, we're going
to end up here with our

473
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:29,100
products, again at T1 plus our
calorimeter at T1, right.

474
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:33,520
So now we have a
constant volume

475
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:41,810
reversible temperature change.

476
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:47,760
And so this part now isn't
exactly what we want to

477
00:36:47,760 --> 00:37:00,540
determine delta H, because it's
a isothermal constant

478
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,490
volume, reversible products or
reversible process that takes

479
00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:11,170
a reactant to T1 to
a product of T1.

480
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,440
What these are going to give
us are delta u values.

481
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,810
This'll give us delta u of
reaction, right, T1, right.

482
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:25,070
It's a constant volume.

483
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,190
All right, so in the end, we're
going to determine delta

484
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,910
u here, and then in the end,
we're going to have to relate

485
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:32,790
that to delta H, but that's
straight forward enough to do.

486
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:38,060
So let's look at how we'll
analyze what happens.

487
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:48,850
So one adiabatic, constant
volume process, right.

488
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,290
What's zero in that case?

489
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:53,260
In this case delta
H was zero in the

490
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,170
constant pressure example.

491
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:59,790
Now we've got a constant
volume process.

492
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:03,410
What's zero?

493
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:07,880
It's u, because u is to q plus
w right, heat and work, but

494
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,250
it's adiabatic.

495
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:14,050
So there's no heat, exchange
with the environment, and it's

496
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:20,020
constant volume, so there's
no p dV work, right.

497
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:29,320
So q is zero adiabatic.

498
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,000
Work is zero.

499
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,850
Delta u1 is zero.

500
00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:45,390
And again just in the constant
pressure case, what happens

501
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,960
that we're going to measure in
step one, which is to say in

502
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,650
actually running the
reaction is the

503
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,480
temperature's going to change.

504
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:54,960
Right?

505
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,200
The whole thing's going to come
to some new equilibrium

506
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,250
temperature between the products
and the oil or

507
00:39:00,250 --> 00:39:04,480
whatever's around it, and we're
going to measure that.

508
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:13,540
OK, two, now it's a temperature
change, right?

509
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:17,490
We know how to calculate delta
u for a temperature change.

510
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,420
It's very similar here, but
what's going to be different

511
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:28,870
from the case with constant
pressure?

512
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:32,470
There's a real important detail
that's different if you

513
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:35,790
want to calculate what happens
at constant pressure when you

514
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,980
change the temperature?

515
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:40,220
What happens at constant
volume?

516
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,000
Looking at this expression,
what's got to be different?

517
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,800
Cv, right.

518
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,240
We're not going to have the
constant pressure heat

519
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,860
capacity, we're going to have
the constant volume heat

520
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,620
capacity, right.

521
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:57,800
So delta u for step two, that's
our q under constant

522
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:05,760
volume conditions, integral
from T1 to T2 Cv for our

523
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,030
whole system dT.

524
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:19,030
Integral from T2 to T2, and now
I can separate again the

525
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,930
calorimeter from the product,
and at least approximately,

526
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:34,400
again, it'll be Cv for the
calorimeter dT, which is to

527
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,700
say then it's Cv of
the calorimeter

528
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:50,290
times delta T. Great.

529
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:55,310
Three, well delta u1 was zero.

530
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:03,910
Delta u2 was there Cv delta T,
so now all we need since the

531
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,820
whole thing is going around in
a cycle, Since we know delta

532
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:17,410
u3 must be negative delta u2,
and that is our delta u of

533
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:46,560
reaction, right?

534
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,800
So delta u of reaction is
approximately equal to

535
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,500
negative Cv for the calorimeter
times delta T. So,

536
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:07,530
this is what we're going to
measure, and this is what

537
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:09,490
we're going to determine.

538
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:13,100
And now we're almost done,
except what we really want is

539
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,530
delta H and not delta
V, right.

540
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:25,320
So now we're going to use the
fact that H is u plus pV.

541
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:38,770
Delta H is delta u plus delta
pV, and now this is all at

542
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,570
constant temperature
in the end, right?

543
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:46,180
We've determined delta u for
some temperature T1, right.

544
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:49,210
So what happens then
we're going to use

545
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,000
the ideal gas law.

546
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,270
So it's approximately delta
u plus delta nRT.

547
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,440
That's a constant.

548
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,300
That's a constant.

549
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:10,050
So it's delta u plus RT, we can
say T1 is the temperature

550
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,060
we've used here, delta
n of the gas.

551
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:18,620
In other words, what matters
here in changing the pressure

552
00:43:18,620 --> 00:43:19,730
volume product?

553
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:23,050
What matters is we turned some
reactants into some products.

554
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:26,000
How many moles of gas are
there in each case, in

555
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,180
reactants and products?

556
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,840
If that changes, of course you
know that the pressure in

557
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,850
there is going to change at
constant volume if the amount

558
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,940
of gas in there is changing.

559
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:37,840
And nothing else is going
to make a significant

560
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:46,560
contribution to it, OK?

561
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:53,720
So finally, then delta H of
reaction for our temperature

562
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,750
T1 is approximately minus Cv of
the calorimeter times delta

563
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:07,680
T plus R T1 delta n of gas.

564
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:12,450
Change of the number of
moles of gas, right.

565
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:17,400
We're going to measure that,
and now we're going to

566
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,850
determine this.

567
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,630
In practice, we'll already know
the heat capacity of our

568
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,520
calorimeter, when we
buy it, right?

569
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,730
So we don't really need to put
in a certain amount of heat

570
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:34,530
and change the temperature
of the products and the

571
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,740
calorimeter and so on.

572
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:37,450
What we need to do is just
measure how much the

573
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:45,370
temperature changed, OK.

574
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:48,640
It's worth getting just sort of
roughly calibrated how big

575
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,130
is this compared to the
rest of this stuff.

576
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,950
That is, how different
is delta u from

577
00:44:55,950 --> 00:44:58,120
delta H, all right.

578
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,250
And of course it's
straightforward to do this,

579
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:03,930
and I've written this out in the
notes, so I won't re-write

580
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:05,030
the numbers here.

581
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,490
But I gave an example
looking at combining

582
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,690
HCl and oxygen right.

583
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:18,150
So 4 HCl plus oxygen gas.

584
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:26,730
This two in the gas going to
water and the liquid, plus

585
00:45:26,730 --> 00:45:30,160
chlorine gas at room
temperature.

586
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:38,020
Well, what you find out is delta
u of reaction is minus

587
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:43,960
195 kilojoules for the
reaction as written.

588
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,090
And it turns out, as written, if
you say OK, how much, what

589
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,100
changed for the pV product?

590
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,720
Well here we've got four moles
of gas, five moles of gas.

591
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,880
Here just two, so we changed
the number of

592
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,600
moles of gas by three.

593
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:01,080
All right, how much did
it matter, right?

594
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,010
Well it matters.

595
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:03,130
It's measurable.

596
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:09,330
So now delta H of reaction
turns out to be minus 202

597
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:12,540
kilojoules.

598
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:15,815
So, you know, seven out of a
couple of a hundred, right, a

599
00:46:15,815 --> 00:46:18,810
few percent, kind of typical.

600
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,920
In other words, if you look
at energetics of ordinary

601
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:23,480
reactions where you're, you
know, you're making and

602
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,045
breaking covalent bonds, there's
a fair amount of

603
00:46:26,045 --> 00:46:28,660
energy stored in those, right?

604
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:33,860
The additional change due to
changing pressure volume is

605
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:34,960
certainly measurable.

606
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,510
You don't want to just ignore
it, but in cases like that,

607
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,310
it's usually a small fraction
of the total.

608
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:47,560
A few percent is
typical, okay.

609
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:54,190
All right, let me just go
through one numerical example

610
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,510
of a calorimetry calculation,
OK.

611
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,070
I won't put all the numbers up
on the board because our time

612
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,470
is running short, but I just
want to outline it.

613
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,870
All I really want to do is
calibrate you a little bit for

614
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:13,760
what happens with ordinary
calorimeter heat capacities

615
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:16,740
that makes the calculation
turn out to be relatively

616
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,240
easy, right.

617
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:22,580
So let's just write it out.

618
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:30,590
Let's take iron sulfide as a
solid, plus 11 halves oxygen

619
00:47:30,590 --> 00:47:40,240
gas to make iron oxide,
also a solid, plus

620
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,820
sulphur dioxide gas.

621
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,460
All right.

622
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:53,060
We'll start at T1
is 298 Kelvin.

623
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:59,460
T2, maybe we don't know
it yet, right.

624
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:11,740
OK, so we know how to calculate
what's going to

625
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,320
happen, delta H and delta u,
because we can look up the

626
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,400
heats of formation and
so forth of all

627
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,080
the compounds, right.

628
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:26,200
So if we do that, what we
discover is that delta H of

629
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,320
formation whoops, something's
wrong here.

630
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:35,390
This is sulphur -- what am I
doing, boy, S and it's a two,

631
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:40,040
sorry, and the heat of formation
is minus 180

632
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:47,600
kilojoules per mole, that's
oxygen, it's zero.

633
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:52,020
Boy, I'm, I don't know what is
about this reaction that's

634
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:53,980
vexing me but it's not
that complicated.

635
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:00,840
Here it's minus 824 kilojoules
per mole minus 297 kilojoules

636
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,920
per mole, right.

637
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:07,340
So that's our input
thermodynamic data.

638
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:16,030
So first of all, let's just
do a heat of reaction

639
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:16,950
calculation, right.

640
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,930
Taking the product minus
the reaction, right.

641
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:29,890
So it's minus 824 plus 4
times minus 297 minus

642
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,450
2 times minus 180.

643
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:34,120
Right?

644
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,540
In other words I've got the
stoichiometric coefficients in

645
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,840
there and the values, and I'm
subtracting the reactants from

646
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:49,370
products wind up with minus
1652 kilojoules per mole.

647
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,440
Well, it depends on what we
write, what we consider mole,

648
00:49:52,440 --> 00:50:04,150
right, maybe I should just write
kilojoules as written.

649
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:16,010
OK, I'm going to skip the delta
and get the change in

650
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:18,055
moles of gas calculation.

651
00:50:18,055 --> 00:50:19,530
It's straightforward to do.

652
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,680
What I really want to do is just
give an example of what

653
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,900
happens when you throw the
thing, the material into a

654
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,930
calorimeter and see how much
the temperature changes.

655
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:38,340
So let's imagine we start with
0.1 moles of our iron sulfide,

656
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,250
and then we have a
stoichiometric amount of

657
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:43,200
oxygen, and the whole thing is
done in a constant volume

658
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:45,010
calorimeter, and we
see what happens.

659
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:47,870
Now the crucial element is what
is the heat capacity of

660
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,930
the calorimeter, right?

661
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:53,320
And it's, again it's a
macroscopic pretty big thing,

662
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,540
so typical might be 10
kilojoules per Kelvin, and

663
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:00,820
that's pretty big, right?

664
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:02,880
Noticed that's not
per mole, right.

665
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,820
I mean the calorimeter is a big
thing filled the little

666
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,370
oil or whatever is
inside it, right?

667
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,180
And it's for that whole
unit that you've

668
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,400
got some heat capacity.

669
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:14,780
How much heat does it take the
warm the entire thing up or

670
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,140
the insides of the thing
up by a degree?

671
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:20,480
It's that number right.

672
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,230
Ordinary heat capacities are
in Joule's per Kelvin mole,

673
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:25,690
not kilojoules, right.

674
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,865
And what that's telling you is
probably your reactants and

675
00:51:28,865 --> 00:51:30,850
products, so the amount of
heat that's involved in

676
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,820
changing the air temperature
is going to be negligible

677
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:36,610
compared to what happens to
the whole calorimeter.

678
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:39,530
OK?

679
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:46,000
So now if we say, OK, we we've
done this calculation starting

680
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,980
with 2 moles of this, but now
we're going to be at 0.1 mole,

681
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,830
so we're going to need to
divide by 20, right.

682
00:51:51,830 --> 00:51:57,950
So instead of minus 1652, it's
going to turn out delta u is

683
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:07,980
minus 1648 kilojoules, so, and
then divide by twenty, we end

684
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:17,250
up with minus 82.4 kilojoules,
that is, that's the delta u of

685
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:21,620
reaction for what happens if
you'd put in not two moles of

686
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,400
this, but 0.1 mole
of this, right.

687
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,860
Practical amounts is the reason
I'm using numbers like

688
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:28,970
this, right.

689
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:32,050
So now, what's delta T?

690
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:41,060
Well here's Cv, right, so delta
T is just our minus 10

691
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:50,640
kilojoules per degree oh sorry,
it's our minus 82.4

692
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:59,930
kilojoules.

693
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:06,280
That's the heat released,
divided by minus 10 or 10

694
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:11,630
kilojoules per Kelvin, right.

695
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:14,070
It's 8.2 Kelvin.

696
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:18,450
In other words, how much does
the temperature of the whole

697
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:21,060
thing change when you put an
ordinary amount of material in

698
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,940
there and run a reaction,
right.

699
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:23,620
Well, what do you do?

700
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:27,300
You calculate how much heat is
released in the reaction.

701
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:29,800
And then what's going to matter
is what's the heat

702
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,420
capacity of the whole,
of the calorimeter?

703
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,750
I didn't even need to know
that heat capacity of the

704
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,100
product, right.

705
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:42,110
Because it's effect the thermal
mass of the product is

706
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,080
negligible compared to the
thermal mass of the

707
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,200
calorimeter.

708
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,650
Now in real practice, I'll do
the calculation in reverse.

709
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:53,870
I'll measure how much the
temperature changed in the

710
00:53:53,870 --> 00:53:56,040
calorimeter, right.

711
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,740
I'll know the heat capacity,
and what I'll really be

712
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:02,440
calculating is OK, how much heat
must have been released

713
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:06,080
in the reaction to make that
temperature change happen?

714
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,100
And that in the case of constant
volume, in this case

715
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:12,305
that's my delta u, and then
I'll add my little delta n

716
00:54:12,305 --> 00:54:16,360
term to get delta H.

717
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,260
Any questions on calorimetry?

718
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:20,950
OK.

719
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:21,710
See you Friday.

720
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:26,670
We'll finish on calorimetry and
thermochemistry and then

721
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:30,670
we'll start in on one of the
really most difficult topics

722
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,020
that we'll deal with all
semester, which is a second

723
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:36,550
law and our special function
that we've seen just a little

724
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,110
bit so far.
