8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,250
PROFESSOR: So.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,180
In the meantime, you've started
looking at two phase

10
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,300
equilibrium.

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,970
So now we're starting
to look at mixtures.

12
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,560
And so now we have more
than one constituent.

13
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,960
And we have more than
one phase present.

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,930
Right?

15
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:45,750
So you've started to look at
things that look like this,

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,800
where you've got, let's
say, two components.

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:02,680
Both in the gas phase.

18
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,580
And now to try to figure
out what the phase

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,870
equilibria look like.

20
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,530
Of course it's now a little bit
more complicated than what

21
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,070
you went through before, where
you can get pressure

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,910
temperature phase diagrams with
just a single component.

23
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:18,050
Now we want to worry about
what's the composition.

24
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:19,620
Of each of the components.

25
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,980
In each of the phases.

26
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:24,110
And what's the temperature
and the pressure.

27
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,930
Total and partial pressures
and all of that.

28
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,430
So you can really figure out
everything about both phases.

29
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,030
And there are all sorts of
important reasons to do that,

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,820
obviously lots of chemistry
happens in liquid mixtures.

31
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,900
Some in gas mixtures.

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,010
Some where they're
in equilibrium.

33
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,780
All sorts of chemical
processes.

34
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:45,100
Distillation, for example,
takes advantage of the

35
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,580
properties of liquid
and gas mixtures.

36
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,400
Where one of them might be
richer, will be richer, and

37
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,820
the more volatile of
the components.

38
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,270
That can be used as a basis
for purification.

39
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,120
You mix ethanol and water
together so you've got a

40
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,060
liquid with a certain
composition of each.

41
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,750
The gas is going to be richer
and the more volatile of the

42
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,400
two, the ethanol.

43
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:10,420
So in a distillation, where you
put things up in the gas,

44
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,150
more of the ethanol comes up.

45
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,190
You could then collect
that gas, right?

46
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,330
And re-condense it, and
make a new liquid.

47
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:20,410
Which is much richer in ethanol
than the original

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,750
liquid was.

49
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,410
Then you could make, then you
could put some of them up into

50
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,590
the gas phase.

51
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,230
Where it will be still
richer in ethanol.

52
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,250
And then you could collect that
and repeat the process.

53
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,740
So the point is that properties
of liquid gas,

54
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,920
two-component or multi-component
mixtures like

55
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,820
this can be exploited.

56
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,180
Basically, the different
volatilities of the different

57
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:48,510
components can be exploited for
things like purification.

58
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,100
Also if you want to calculate
chemical equilibria in the

59
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,820
liquid and gas phase, of
course, now you've seen

60
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:57,100
chemical equilibrium, so the
amount of reaction depends on

61
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,910
the composition.

62
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:01,990
So of course if you want
reactions to go, then this

63
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,110
also can be exploited by looking
at which phase might

64
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,460
be richer in one reactant
or another.

65
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,220
And thereby pushing the
equilibrium toward one

66
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:12,120
direction or the other.

67
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,950
OK.

68
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:19,290
So. we've got some total
temperature and pressure.

69
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:29,350
And we have compositions.

70
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,020
So in the gas phase, we've got
mole fractions yA and yB.

71
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:41,580
In the liquid phase we've got
mole fractions xA and xB.

72
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,300
So that's our system.

73
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,190
One of the things that you
established last time is that,

74
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:58,010
so there are the total number
of variables including the

75
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,070
temperature and the pressure.

76
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,950
And let's say the mole fraction
of A in each of the

77
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,670
liquid and gas phases, right?

78
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,870
But then there are
constraints.

79
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,660
Because the chemical
potentials have

80
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,330
to be equal, right?

81
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,320
Chemical potential of
A has to be equal in

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,010
the liquid and gas.

83
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,270
Same with B. Those two
constraints reduce the number

84
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:20,840
of independent variables.

85
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:23,590
So there'll be two in this
case rather than four

86
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,750
independent variables.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,380
If you control those, then
everything else will follow.

88
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,050
What that means is if you've got
a, if you control, if you

89
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,960
fix the temperature and the
total pressure, everything

90
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,650
else should be determinable.

91
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,200
No more free variables.

92
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:48,150
And then, what you saw is that
in simple or ideal liquid

93
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:57,800
mixtures, a result called
Raoult's law would hold.

94
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,090
Which just says that the partial
pressure of A is equal

95
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:10,150
to the mole fraction of A in the
liquid times the pressure

96
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,830
of pure A over the liquid.

97
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:18,140
And so what this gives
you is a diagram

98
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,080
that looks like this.

99
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,490
If we plot this versus xB, this
is mole fraction of B in

100
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:28,540
the liquid going from
zero to one.

101
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:39,050
Then we could construct a
diagram of this sort.

102
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:46,440
So this is the total pressure
of A and B. The partial

103
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:53,490
pressures are given
by these lines.

104
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,390
So this is our pA star
and pB star.

105
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:04,060
The pressures over the pure
liquid A and B at the limits

106
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:07,830
of mole fraction of B
being zero and one.

107
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:11,050
So in this situation, for
example, A is the more

108
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,640
volatile of the components.

109
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,770
So it's partial pressure
over its pure liquid.

110
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,580
At this temperature.

111
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,280
Is higher than the partial
pressure of B

112
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,410
over its pure liquid.

113
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:24,440
A would be the ethanol, for
example and B the water in

114
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,140
that mixture.

115
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:33,320
OK.

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,340
Then you started looking at both
the gas and the liquid

117
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,600
phase in the same diagram.

118
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,520
So this is the mole fraction
of the liquid.

119
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,810
If you look and see, well, OK
now we should be able to

120
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,310
determine the mole fraction
in the gas as well.

121
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,520
Again, if we note total
temperature and pressure,

122
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,900
everything else must follow.

123
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:05,090
And so, you saw this
worked out.

124
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:15,060
Relation between p and
yA, for example.

125
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:23,940
The result was p is pA star
times pB star over pA star

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:31,250
plus pB star minus
pA star times yA.

127
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,260
And the point here is that
unlike this case, where you

128
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,680
have a linear relationship, the
relationship between the

129
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,730
pressure and the liquid mole
fraction isn't linear.

130
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,770
We can still plot
it, of course.

131
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,240
So if we do that, then we end
up with a diagram that looks

132
00:07:51,240 --> 00:08:02,320
like the following.

133
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:12,140
Now I'm going to keep both mole
fractions, xB and yB,

134
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,830
I've got some total pressure.

135
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,720
I still have my linear
relationship.

136
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:30,610
And then I have a non-linear
relationship between the

137
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:36,260
pressure and the mole fraction
in the gas phase.

138
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:49,180
So let's just fill this in.

139
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,260
Here is pA star still.

140
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,220
Here's pB star.

141
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,060
Of course, at the limits they're
still, both mole

142
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:05,220
fractions they're zero and one.

143
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,120
OK.

144
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,290
I believe this is this is where
you ended up at the end

145
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,440
of the last lecture.

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,740
But it's probably not so clear
exactly how you read

147
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,640
something like this.

148
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,650
And use it.

149
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,200
It's extremely useful.

150
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,340
You just have to kind of learn
how to follow what happens in

151
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,500
a diagram like this.

152
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,640
And that's what I want to spend
some of today doing.

153
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,940
Is just, walking through what's
happening physically,

154
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,960
with a container with a
mixture of the two.

155
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,590
And how does that correspond
to what gets read off the

156
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:39,630
diagram under different
conditions.

157
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,500
So.

158
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:55,660
Let's just start somewhere on
a phase diagram like this.

159
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:03,310
Let's start up here at some
point one, so we're in the

160
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,050
pure - well, not pure, you're
in the all liquid phase.

161
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,120
It's still a mixture.

162
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not a pure substance.
pA star, pB star.

163
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,430
There's the gas phase.

164
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:33,460
So, if we start at one, and now

165
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,950
there's some total pressure.

166
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:37,640
And now we're going
to reduce it.

167
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,440
What happens?

168
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:42,190
We start with a pure - with
an all-liquid mixture.

169
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,790
No gas.

170
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,890
And now we're going to bring
down the pressure.

171
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:52,270
Allowing some of the liquid to
go up into the gas phase.

172
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:56,130
So, we can do that.

173
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:02,530
And once we reach point
two, then we find

174
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,290
a coexistence curve.

175
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:09,190
Now the liquid and gas
are going to coexist.

176
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,020
So this is the liquid phase.

177
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:17,270
And that means that
this must be xB.

178
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:21,490
And it's xB at one, but it's
also xB at two, and I want to

179
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,410
emphasize that.

180
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,110
So let's put our pressure
for two.

181
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:38,490
And if we go over here, this is
telling us about the mole

182
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,310
fraction in the gas phase.

183
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:45,140
That's what these curves
are, remember.

184
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,030
So this is the one that's
showing us the mole fraction

185
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,550
in the liquid phase.

186
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,800
This nonlinear one
in the gas phase.

187
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,050
So that means just reading off
it, this is xB, that's the

188
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,540
liquid mole fraction.

189
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,220
Here's yB.

190
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:07,750
The gas mole fraction.

191
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,180
They're not the same, right,
because of course the

192
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,500
components have different
volatility.

193
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,110
A's more volatile.

194
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:21,360
So that means that the mole
fraction of B in the liquid

195
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,900
phase is higher than the
mole fraction of

196
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,460
B in the gas phase.

197
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,370
Because A is the more
volatile component.

198
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,990
So more, relatively more, of A,
the mole fraction of A is

199
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,730
going to be higher up
in the gas phase.

200
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,230
Which means the mole
fraction of B is

201
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:43,840
lower in the gas phase.

202
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:58,490
So, yB less than xB if
A is more volatile.

203
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,140
OK, so now what's happening
physically?

204
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:09,910
Well, we started at a
point where we only

205
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,970
had the liquid present.

206
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:23,790
So at our initial pressure,
we just have all liquid.

207
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:29,800
There's some xB at one.

208
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,060
That's all there is, there
isn't any gas yet.

209
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,110
Now, what happened here?

210
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,200
Well, now we lowered
the pressure.

211
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,710
So you could imagine, well,
we made the box bigger.

212
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,800
Now, if the liquid was under
pressure, being squeezed by

213
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,530
the box, right then you
could make the box

214
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,270
a little bit bigger.

215
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,880
And there's still no gas.

216
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,540
That's moving down like this.

217
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,220
But then you get to a point
where there's just barely any

218
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,660
pressure on top of the liquid.

219
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,680
And then you keep expanding
the box.

220
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,780
Now some gas is going to form.

221
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:13,350
So now we're going to
go to our case two.

222
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:16,740
We've got a bigger box.

223
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,855
And now, right around
where this was, this

224
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:22,610
is going to be liquid.

225
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,850
And there's gas up here.

226
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,330
So up here is yB at
pressure two.

227
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:35,900
Here's xB at pressure two.

228
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,590
Liquid and gas.

229
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:49,110
So that's where we are
at point two here.

230
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,760
Now, what happens if
we keep going?

231
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,560
Let's lower the pressure
some more.

232
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,610
Well, we can lower
it and do this.

233
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,020
But really if we want to see
what's happening in each of

234
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,490
the phases, we have to stay
on the coexistence curves.

235
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,260
Those are what tell us what
the pressures are.

236
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,520
What the partial pressure
are going to be

237
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,670
in each of the phases.

238
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,240
In each of the two, in the
liquid and the gas phases.

239
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,930
So let's say we lower the
pressure a little more.

240
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,120
What's going to happen
is, then we'll end up

241
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,870
somewhere over here.

242
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,270
In the liquid, and that'll
correspond to something over

243
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,220
here in the gas.

244
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,980
So here's three.

245
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:46,570
So now we're going to have,
that's going to be xB at

246
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,320
pressure three.

247
00:15:48,320 --> 00:16:01,800
And over here is going to
be yB at pressure three.

248
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,840
And all we've done, of
course, is we've just

249
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,090
expanded this further.

250
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:12,250
So now we've got a
still taller box.

251
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,960
And the liquid is going to be a
little lower because some of

252
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:21,170
it has evaporated, formed
the gas phase.

253
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,710
So here's xB at three.

254
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:32,530
Here's yB at three, here's
our gas phase.

255
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:38,740
Now we could decrease
even further.

256
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,120
And this is the sort of
thing that you maybe

257
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,980
can't do in real life.

258
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:45,590
But I can do on a blackboard.

259
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,190
I'm going to give myself more
room on this curve, to finish

260
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:59,810
this illustration.

261
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,810
There.

262
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,990
Beautiful.

263
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:06,030
So now we can lower a little bit
further, and what I want

264
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,450
to illustrate is, if we keep
going down, eventually we get

265
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:14,980
to a pressure where now if we
look over in the gas phase,

266
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:17,860
we're at the same pressure,
mole fraction that we had

267
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,340
originally in the
liquid phase.

268
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:27,380
So let's make four even
lower pressure.

269
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,990
What does that mean?

270
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:35,560
What it means is, we're
running out of liquid.

271
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,770
So what's supposed to
happen is A is the

272
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,620
more volatile component.

273
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:47,580
So as we start opening up some
room for gas to form, you get

274
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,430
more of A in the gas phase.

275
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:56,390
But of course, and the liquid is
richer in B. But of course,

276
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,020
eventually you run
out of liquid.

277
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:05,810
You make the box pretty big, and
you run out, or you have

278
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,670
the very last drop of liquid.

279
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,150
So what's the mole fraction
of B in the gas phase?

280
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:14,640
It has to be the same as
what it started in

281
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,370
in the liquid phase.

282
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,720
Because after all the total
number of moles of A and B

283
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:18,950
hasn't changed any.

284
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,900
So if you take them all from the
liquid and put them all up

285
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,080
into the gas phase, it
must be the same.

286
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,350
So yB of four.

287
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:38,730
Once you just have
the last drop.

288
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,250
So then yB of four is basically
equal to xB of one.

289
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:49,110
Because everything's now
up in the gas phase.

290
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:56,390
So in principle, there's still
a tiny, tiny bit of xB at

291
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,030
pressure four.

292
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,500
Well, we could keep lowering
the pressure.

293
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,850
We could make the box
a little bigger.

294
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:06,240
Then the very last of the liquid
is going to be gone.

295
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,180
And what'll happen then
is, we're all here.

296
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,200
There's no more liquid.

297
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:13,100
We're not going down on the
coexistence curve any more.

298
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,660
We don't have a liquid gas
coexistence any more.

299
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,640
We just have a gas phase.

300
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,010
Of course, we can continue
to lower the pressure.

301
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:24,580
And then what we're doing
is just going down here.

302
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,370
So there's five.

303
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:32,160
And five is the same as
this only bigger.

304
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,560
And so forth.

305
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:40,050
OK, any questions about
how this works?

306
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:45,650
It's really important to just
gain facility in reading these

307
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:51,320
things and seeing, OK, what is
it that this is telling you.

308
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,730
And you can see it's not
complicated to do it, but it

309
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,880
takes a little bit of practice.

310
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
OK.

311
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,550
Now, of course, we could do
exactly the same thing

312
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,670
starting from the gas phase.

313
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,830
And raising the pressure.

314
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,020
And although you may anticipate
that it's kind of

315
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,560
pedantic, I really do want to
illustrate something by it.

316
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,960
So let me just imagine that
we're going to do that.

317
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:34,550
Let's start all in
the gas phase.

318
00:20:34,550 --> 00:20:49,050
Up here's the liquid.
pA star, pB star.

319
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:55,480
And now let's start
somewhere here.

320
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,230
So we're down somewhere in
the gas phase with some

321
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,710
composition.

322
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,030
So it's the same story, except
now we're starting here.

323
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:02,680
It's all gas.

324
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,780
And we're going to
start squeezing.

325
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,780
We're increasing the pressure.

326
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:14,530
And eventually here's one, will
reach two, so of course

327
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,580
here's our yB.

328
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,590
We started with all
gas, no liquid.

329
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,980
So this is yB of one.

330
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,880
It's the same as yB of two, I'm
just raising the pressure

331
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:32,530
enough to just reach the
coexistence curve.

332
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:40,810
And of course, out here tells
us xB of two, right?

333
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:42,180
So what is it saying?

334
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:45,730
We've squeezed and started
to form some liquid.

335
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,650
And the liquid is richer in
component B. Maybe it's

336
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,590
ethanol water again.

337
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,650
And we squeeze, and now we've
got more water in the liquid

338
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,280
phase than in the gas phase.

339
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,100
Because water's the less
volatile component.

340
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:04,100
It's what's going to
condense first.

341
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,680
So the liquid is rich in the
less volatile of the

342
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,030
components.

343
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:14,240
Now, obviously, we can continue
in doing exactly the

344
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,320
reverse of what I showed you.

345
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:18,120
But all I want to really
illustrate is, this is a

346
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,200
strategy for purification of the
less volatile component.

347
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,880
Once you've done this, well now
you've got some liquid.

348
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,950
Now you could collect that
liquid in a separate vessel.

349
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:46,160
So let's collect the liquid
mixture with xB of two.

350
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,320
So it's got some mole fraction
of B. So we've purified that.

351
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,860
But now we're going to start,
we've got pure liquid.

352
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,880
Now let's make the vessel big.

353
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,650
So it all goes into
the gas phase.

354
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:04,150
Then lower p.

355
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,460
All gas.

356
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,990
So we start with yB of three,
which equals xB of two.

357
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,290
In other words, it's the
same mole fraction.

358
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:32,510
So let's reconstruct that.

359
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,810
So here's p of two.

360
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:41,470
And now we're going to go
to some new pressure.

361
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:47,050
And the point is, now we're
going to start, since the mole

362
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,950
fraction in the gas phase that
we're starting from is the

363
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,550
same number as this was.

364
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:54,460
So it's around here somewhere.

365
00:23:54,460 --> 00:24:01,490
That's yB of three
equals xB of two.

366
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,050
And we're down here.

367
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,620
In other words, all we've done
is make the container big

368
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:11,820
enough so the pressure's low and
it's all in the gas phase.

369
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,180
That's all we have,
is the gas.

370
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,590
But the composition is whatever
the composition is

371
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,500
that we extracted here
from the liquid.

372
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:24,460
So this xB, which is the liquid
mole fraction, is now

373
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,290
yB, the gas mole fraction.

374
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,900
Of course, the pressure
is different.

375
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:30,950
Lower than it was before.

376
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:31,990
Great.

377
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:34,460
Now let's increase.

378
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,880
So here's three.

379
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,840
And now let's increase
the pressure to four.

380
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,700
And of course what happens,
now we've got coexistence.

381
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,630
So here's liquid.

382
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,940
Here's gas.

383
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:57,180
So, now we're over here again.

384
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,870
There's xB at pressure four.

385
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:10,850
Pure still in component B. We
can repeat the same procedure.

386
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:12,060
Collect it.

387
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,640
All liquid, put it
in a new vessel.

388
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:18,000
Expand it, lower the pressure,
all goes back

389
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,400
into the gas phase.

390
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,800
Do it all again.

391
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,810
And the point is, what you're
doing is walking along here.

392
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:25,830
Here to here.

393
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:28,600
Then you start down here, and
go from here to here.

394
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,020
From here to here.

395
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:31,870
And you can purify.

396
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:36,440
Now, of course, the optimal
procedure, you have to think a

397
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:36,860
little bit.

398
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,890
Because if you really do
precisely what I said, you're

399
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:43,480
going to have a mighty little
bit of material

400
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,540
each time you do that.

401
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,800
So yes it'll be the little bit
you've gotten at the end is

402
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,670
going to be really pure, but
there's not a whole lot of it.

403
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,710
Because, remember, what we
said is let's raise the

404
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,340
pressure until we just
start being on

405
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,130
the coexistence curve.

406
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,150
So we've still got mostly gas.

407
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:05,430
Little bit of liquid.

408
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,810
Now, I could raise the pressure
a bit higher.

409
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:11,340
So that in the interest of
having more of the liquid,

410
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:15,400
when I do that, though, the
liquid that I have at this

411
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:20,060
higher pressure won't be as
enriched as it was down here.

412
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,890
Now, I could still do
this procedure.

413
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,560
I could just do more of them.

414
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,060
So it takes a little bit of
judiciousness to figure out

415
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,660
how to optimize that.

416
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,060
In the end, though, you can
continue to walk your way down

417
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:38,810
through these coexistence curves
and purify repeatedly

418
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:42,760
the component B, the less
volatile of them, and end up

419
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,920
with some amount of it.

420
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,550
And there'll be some balance
between the amount that you

421
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,730
feel like you need to end
up with and how pure

422
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,470
you need it to be.

423
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,280
Any questions about
how this works?

424
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:16,210
So purification of less
volatile components.

425
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,290
Now, how much of each of
these quantities in

426
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,920
each of these phases?

427
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:25,490
So, pertinent to this
discussion, of course we need

428
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,860
to know that.

429
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,010
If you want to try to optimize
a procedure like that, of

430
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:32,110
course it's going to be
crucial to be able to

431
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,650
understand and calculate for any
pressure that you decide

432
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:42,720
to raise to, just how many moles
do you have in each of

433
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,690
the phases?

434
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:47,290
So at the end of the day, you
can figure out, OK, now when I

435
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,620
reach a certain degree of
purification, here's how much

436
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,520
of the stuff I end up with.

437
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,550
Well, that turns out
to be reasonably

438
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:57,570
straightforward to do.

439
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,120
And so what I'll go through
is a simple mathematical

440
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,170
derivation.

441
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:05,160
And it turns out that it allows
you to just read right

442
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,170
off the diagram how much of each
material you're going to

443
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,420
end up with.

444
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:15,680
So, here's what happens.

445
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,830
This is something called
the lever rule.

446
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:39,880
How much of each component
is there in each phase?

447
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:52,630
So let's consider a
case like this.

448
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:58,550
Let me draw yet once again,
just to get the numbering

449
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,260
consistent.

450
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:07,220
With how we'll treat this.

451
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,330
So we're going to start here.

452
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,760
And I want to draw it right
in the middle, so I've

453
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,090
got plenty of room.

454
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:26,550
And we're going to go
up to some pressure.

455
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,360
And somewhere out there,
now I can go to

456
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,410
my coexistence curves.

457
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,190
Liquid.

458
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,630
And gas.

459
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:40,460
And I can read off my values.

460
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,280
So this is the liquid xB.

461
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:52,060
So I'm going to go up to some
point two, here's xB of two.

462
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:57,100
Here's yB of two.

463
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:00,120
Great.

464
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:10,310
Now let's get these
written in.

465
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:17,060
So let's just define terms
a little bit. nA, nB.

466
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:28,900
Or just our total number of
moles. ng and n liquid, of

467
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:38,040
course, total number of moles.

468
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,990
In the gas and liquid phases.

469
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:44,010
So let's just do the calculation
for each

470
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,820
of these two cases.

471
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,670
We'll start with one.

472
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,790
That's the easier case.

473
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:51,040
Because then we have
only the gas.

474
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:57,720
So at one, all gas.

475
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:00,020
It says pure gas in the notes,
but of course that

476
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:00,850
isn't the pure gas.

477
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:04,400
It's the mixture of the
two components.

478
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,760
So.

479
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,750
How many moles of A?

480
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,760
Well it's the mole fraction
of A in the gas.

481
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:17,830
Times the total number
of moles in the gas.

482
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,630
Let me put one in here.

483
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:25,300
Just to be clear.

484
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,350
And since we have all gas, the
number of moles in the gas is

485
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,290
just the total number
of moles.

486
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:37,570
So this is just yA at
one times n total.

487
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:38,610
Let's just write that in.

488
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,220
And of course n total is
equal to nA plus nB.

489
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,990
So now let's look at
condition two.

490
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,820
Now we have to look a little
more carefully.

491
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:03,790
Because we have a liquid
gas mixture.

492
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:11,970
So nA is equal to yA
at pressure two.

493
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:19,190
Times the number of moles
of gas at pressure two.

494
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:23,322
Plus xA, at pressure two, times
the number of moles of

495
00:32:23,322 --> 00:32:38,240
liquid at pressure two.

496
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,780
Now, of course, these things
have to be equal.

497
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:45,230
The total number of moles of
A didn't change, right?

498
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:52,900
So those are equal.

499
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:58,580
Then yA of two times
ng of two.

500
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:08,770
Plus xA of two times n liquid of
two, that's equal to yA of

501
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,520
one times n total.

502
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:20,460
Which is of course equal to yA
of one times n gas at two plus

503
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,350
n liquid at two.

504
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,380
I suppose I could be,
add that equality.

505
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,540
Of course, it's an
obvious one.

506
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,030
But let me do it anyway.

507
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:32,770
The total number of moles
is equal to nA plus nB.

508
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:40,230
But it's also equal to
n liquid plus n gas.

509
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:46,050
And that's all I'm taking
advantage of here.

510
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:47,680
And now I'm just going to
rearrange the terms.

511
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:57,870
So I'm going to write yA at one
minus yA at two, times ng

512
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,120
at two, is equal to, and I'm
going to take the other terms,

513
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:13,490
the xA term. xA of two
minus yA of one

514
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:18,050
times n liquid at two.

515
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:21,570
So I've just rearranged
the terms.

516
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:30,330
And I've done that because
now, I think I omitted

517
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:37,170
something here. yA
of one times ng.

518
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:51,700
No, I forgot a bracket, is what
I did. yA of one there.

519
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,910
And I did this because now I
want to do is look at the

520
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:57,040
ratio of liquid to gas
at pressure two.

521
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:10,750
So, ratio of I'll put it gas
to liquid, that's ng of two

522
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,870
over n liquid at two.

523
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:26,990
And that's just equal to xA of
two minus yA at one minus yA

524
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:37,070
at one minus yA at two.

525
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,420
So what does it mean?

526
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:45,100
It's the ratio of these
lever arms.

527
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,570
That's what it's telling me.

528
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:51,380
I can look, so I raise the
pressure up to two.

529
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,520
And so here's xB at two,
here's yB at two.

530
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,960
And I'm here somewhere.

531
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:08,640
And this little amount and this
little amount, that's

532
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,440
that difference.

533
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,020
And it's just telling me that
ratio of those arms is the

534
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,900
ratio of the total number of
moles of gas to liquid.

535
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,250
And that's great.

536
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,000
Because now when I go back to
the problem that we were just

537
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,100
looking at, where I say, well
I'm going to purify the less

538
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:27,140
volatile component by raising
the pressure until I'm at

539
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:29,260
coexistence starting
in the gas phase.

540
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,700
Raise the pressure, I've
got some liquid.

541
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,030
But I also want some finite
amount of liquid.

542
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:36,990
But I don't want to just, when
I get the very, very first

543
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:39,840
drop of liquid now collected, of
course it's enriched in the

544
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,910
less volatile component.

545
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:43,970
But there may be a minuscule
amount, right?

546
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:47,710
So I'll raise the pressure
a bit more.

547
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:48,890
I'll go up in pressure.

548
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:53,900
And now, of course, when I do
that the amount of enrichment

549
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:57,710
of the liquid isn't as big as it
was if I just raised it up

550
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,110
enough to barely have
any liquid.

551
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,650
Then I'd be out here.

552
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:06,700
But I've got more material in
the liquid phase to collect.

553
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,710
And that's what this allows
me to calculate.

554
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:13,720
Is how much do I
get in the end.

555
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:16,350
So it's very handy.

556
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:22,420
You can also see, if I go all
the way to the limit where the

557
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:27,020
mole fraction in the liquid at
the end is equal to what it

558
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:32,170
was in the gas when I started,
what that says is that there's

559
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,960
no more gas left any more.

560
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,490
In other words, these two
things are equal.

561
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,580
If I go all the way to the point
where I've got all the,

562
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:49,630
this is the amount I started
with, in the pure gas phase,

563
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,920
now I keep raising
it all the way.

564
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,950
Until I've got the same mole
fraction in the liquid.

565
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:56,770
Of course, we know what
that really means.

566
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,780
That means that I've gone
all the way from

567
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,310
pure gas to pure liquid.

568
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:03,620
And the mole fraction in that
case has to be the same.

569
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,110
And what this is just telling
us mathematically is, when

570
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,280
that happens this is zero.

571
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,660
That means I don't have
any gas left.

572
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,090
Yeah.

573
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:26,390
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

574
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,980
PROFESSOR: No.

575
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,580
Because, so it's the mole
fraction in the gas phase.

576
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:35,960
But you've started with some
amount that it's only going to

577
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,690
go down from there.

578
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,940
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

579
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,290
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

580
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:48,850
Yeah.

581
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,310
Any other questions?

582
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:55,390
OK.

583
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:01,980
Well, now what I want to do
is just put up a slightly

584
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,470
different kind of diagram, but
different in an important way.

585
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,830
Namely, instead of showing the
mole fractions as a function

586
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,640
of the pressure.

587
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,680
And I haven't written it in,
but all of these are at

588
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,030
constant temperature, right?

589
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:17,820
I've assumed the temperature
is constant

590
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,480
in all these things.

591
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,410
Now let's consider the other
possibility, the other simple

592
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:25,960
possibility, which is, let's
hold the pressure constant and

593
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,960
vary the temperature.

594
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,270
Of course, you know in the lab,
that's usually what's

595
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,920
easiest to do.

596
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,350
Now, unfortunately, the
arithmetic gets more

597
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:36,600
complicated.

598
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:41,070
It's not monumentally
complicated, but here in this

599
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:45,820
case, where you have one linear
relationship, which is

600
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,630
very convenient.

601
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,080
From Raoult's law.

602
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,740
And then you have one non-linear
relationship there

603
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,970
for the mole fraction
of the gas.

604
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:59,180
In the case of temperature,
they're both,

605
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,960
neither one is linear.

606
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,730
Nevertheless, we can just
sketch what the

607
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,850
diagram looks like.

608
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,160
And of course it's very useful
to do that, and see how to

609
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,370
read off it.

610
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:13,370
And I should say the derivation
of the curves isn't

611
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,530
particularly complicated.

612
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:16,850
It's not particularly more
complicated than what I think

613
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,600
you saw last time
to derive this.

614
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,600
There's no complicated
math involved.

615
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,730
But the point is, the derivation
doesn't yield a

616
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:28,900
linear relationship for either
the gas or the liquid part of

617
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:54,730
the coexistence curve.

618
00:40:54,730 --> 00:41:03,140
OK, so we're going to look at
temperature and mole fraction

619
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,270
phase diagrams.

620
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:06,460
Again, a little more complicated
mathematically but

621
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:20,160
more practical in real use.

622
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:31,570
And this is T. And here is the,
sort of, form that these

623
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,130
things take.

624
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:35,680
So again, neither
one is linear.

625
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,430
Up here, now, of course if you
raise the temperatures, that's

626
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:41,120
where you end up with gas.

627
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,310
If you lower the temperature,
you

628
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:48,790
condense and get the liquid.

629
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:55,620
So, this is TA star.

630
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,970
TB star.

631
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,020
So now I want to stick
with A as the

632
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:07,590
more volatile component.

633
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:11,030
At constant temperature, that
meant that pA star is bigger

634
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,200
than pB star.

635
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,480
In other words, the vapor
pressure over pure liquid A is

636
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:23,150
higher than the vapor pressure
over pure liquid B. Similarly,

637
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:25,380
now I've got constant pressure
and really what I'm looking

638
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,990
at, let's say I'm at the
limit where I've

639
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,310
got the pure liquid.

640
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,910
Or the pure A. And now I'm going
to, let's say, raise the

641
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:38,920
temperature until I'm at the
liquid-gas equilibrium.

642
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:42,500
That's just the boiling point.

643
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,820
So if A is the more volatile
component, it has the lower

644
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,800
boiling point.

645
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,370
And that's what this reflects.

646
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:54,280
So higher pB star A corresponds
to lower TA star

647
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:59,230
A. Which is just the boiling
point of pure A.

648
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:11,690
So, this is called
the bubble line.

649
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:14,990
That's called the dew line.

650
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,630
All that means is, let's say
I'm at high temperature.

651
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:19,370
I've got all gas.

652
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,090
Right no coexistence,
no liquid yet.

653
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:23,130
And I start to cool
things off.

654
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,820
Just to where I just barely
start to get liquid.

655
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:29,230
What you see that as is,
dew starts forming.

656
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,570
A little bit of condensation.

657
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,765
If you're outside, it means on
the grass a little bit of dew

658
00:43:32,765 --> 00:43:34,440
is forming.

659
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,300
Similarly, if I start at low
temperature, all liquid now I

660
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,660
start raising the temperature
until I just start to boil.

661
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,180
I just start to see the
first bubbles forming.

662
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,650
And so that's why these things
have those names.

663
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:56,090
So now let's just follow along
what happens when I do the

664
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:57,780
same sort of thing that
I illustrated there.

665
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,730
I want to start at one point
in this phase diagram.

666
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,890
And then start changing
the conditions.

667
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:17,610
So let's start here.

668
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,330
So I'm going to start all
in the liquid phase.

669
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:22,200
That is, the temperature
is low.

670
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,970
Here's xB.

671
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:27,690
And my original temperature.

672
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:34,570
Now I'm going to raise it.

673
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,590
So if I raise it a little bit,
I reach a point at which I

674
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,600
first start to boil.

675
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:47,890
Start to find some gas
above the liquid.

676
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:51,880
And if I look right here,
that'll be my composition.

677
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,430
Let me raise it a little
farther, now that we've

678
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,100
already seen the lever
rule and so forth.

679
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,140
I'll raise it up to here.

680
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:11,790
And that means that out here,
I suppose I should do here.

681
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:18,730
So, here is the liquid mole
fraction at temperature two.

682
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:23,320
xB at temperature two.

683
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:27,640
This is yB at temperature two.

684
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:33,860
The gas mole fraction.

685
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:37,840
So as you should expect, what's
going to happen here is

686
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:43,510
that the gas, this is going to
be lower in B. A, that means

687
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,570
that the mole fraction
of A must be

688
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:47,020
higher in the gas phase.

689
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,700
That's one minus yB.

690
00:45:49,700 --> 00:46:05,340
So xA is one minus -- yA, which
is one minus yB higher

691
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:10,970
in gas phase.

692
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:16,370
Than xA, which is
one minus xB.

693
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,480
In other words, the less
volatile component is enriched

694
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:39,100
up in the gas phase.

695
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,320
Now, what does that mean?

696
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,890
That means I could follow the
same sort of procedure that I

697
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:50,710
indicated before when we looked
at the pressure mole

698
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:51,930
fraction phase diagram.

699
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:54,970
Namely, I could do this
and now I could

700
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:57,150
take the gas phase.

701
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:01,730
Which has less of B. It
has more of A. And

702
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:03,780
I can collect it.

703
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,210
And then I can reduce
the temperature.

704
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:06,310
So it liquefies.

705
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:08,820
So I can condense it,
in other words.

706
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:11,820
So now I'm going to start with,
let's say I lower the

707
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,710
temperature enough so I've got
basically pure liquid.

708
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:17,500
But its composition is the
same as the gas here.

709
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,850
Because of course that's what
that liquid is formed from.

710
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:23,800
I collected the gas
and separated it.

711
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,830
So now I could start
all over again.

712
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:31,240
Except instead of being here,
I'll be down here.

713
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:33,060
And then I can raise the
temperature again.

714
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:35,020
To some place where I choose.

715
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:37,350
I could choose here, and
go all the way to hear.

716
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:39,120
A great amount of enrichment.

717
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:41,305
But I know from the lever rule
that if I do that, I'm going

718
00:47:41,305 --> 00:47:44,460
to have precious little
material over here.

719
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,730
So I might prefer to raise the
temperature a little more.

720
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,940
Still get a substantial
amount of enrichment.

721
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,370
And now I've got, in the gas
phase, I'll further enriched

722
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:57,880
in component A. And again
I can collect the gas.

723
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,850
Condense it.

724
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:03,280
Now I'm out here somewhere, I've
got all liquid and I'll

725
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,350
raise the temperature again.

726
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:07,380
And I can again keep walking
my way over.

727
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,640
And that's what happens during
an ordinary distillation.

728
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:17,270
Each step of the distillation
walks along in the phase

729
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:23,530
diagram at some selected
point.

730
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,190
And of course what you're
doing is, you're always

731
00:48:25,190 --> 00:48:27,520
condensing the gas.

732
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:30,830
And starting with fresh liquid
that now is enriched in more

733
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:33,860
volatile of the components.

734
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,680
So of course if you're really
purifying, say, ethanol from

735
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,710
an ethanol water mixture,
that's how you do it.

736
00:48:39,710 --> 00:48:41,640
Ethanol is the more volatile
component.

737
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,870
So a still is set up.

738
00:48:42,870 --> 00:48:45,080
It will boil the stuff and
collect the gas and and

739
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:45,920
condense it.

740
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:48,350
And boil it again,
and so forth.

741
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:50,600
And the whole thing can be set
up in a very efficient way.

742
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:53,420
So you have essentially
continuous distillation.

743
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,970
Where you have a whole sequence
of collection and

744
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,610
condensation and reheating
and so forth events.

745
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,930
So then, in a practical way,
it's possible to walk quite

746
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:10,870
far along the distillation,
the coexistence curve, and

747
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:16,630
distill to really a high
degree of purification.

748
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:22,270
Any questions about
how that works?

749
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,240
OK.

750
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,720
I'll leave till next time the
discussion of the chemical

751
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,190
potentials.

752
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,980
But what we'll do, just to
foreshadow a little bit, what

753
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:36,330
I'll do at the beginning of the
next lecture is what's at

754
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:37,280
the end of your notes here.

755
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:40,710
Which is just to say OK, now
if we look at Raoult's law,

756
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,470
it's straightforward to say what
is the chemical potential

757
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:47,290
for each of the substances in
the liquid and the gas phase.

758
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,100
Of course, it has to be equal.

759
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,450
Given that, that's for
an ideal solution.

760
00:49:53,450 --> 00:49:55,490
We can gain some insight
from that.

761
00:49:55,490 --> 00:49:57,930
And then look at real
solutions, non-ideal

762
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:00,860
solutions, and understand a lot
of their behavior as well.

763
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,160
Just from starting from our
understanding of what the

764
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,420
chemical potential does even
in a simple ideal mixture.

765
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,150
So we'll look at the chemical
potentials.

766
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:10,740
And then we'll look at
non-ideal solution

767
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,310
mixtures next time.

768
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,770
See you then.
