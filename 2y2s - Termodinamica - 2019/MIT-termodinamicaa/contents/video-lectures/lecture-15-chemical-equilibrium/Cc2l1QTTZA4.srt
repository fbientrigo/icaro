8
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,790
PROFESSOR: So let's start with
some of the things we

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,850
learned last time.

10
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:49,280
So there are two things
that were important.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,710
We learned that the chemical
potential for a species is the

12
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,140
Gibbs free energy for that
species divided by the number

13
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,800
of moles, this is Gibbs
free energy per mole.

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,050
We learned that the pressure
dependence of the Gibbs free

15
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,270
energy gives you the pressure
dependence for

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,070
the chemical potential.

17
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,960
That it's equal to the chemical
potential at one bar

18
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,700
for an ideal gas
plus RT log p.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:33,270
We also learned that a species
will want to go to minimize

20
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,280
its chemical potential, and we
saw that for the cell bursting

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,610
in salt, in distilled water.

22
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:44,470
Or an ice cube melting
at a temperature

23
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,700
greater than 0 degrees.

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:54,200
And what we want to prove right
now is that if I take a

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,430
species A, in a mixture, some
temperature T, some pressure

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,190
p, and I compare its chemical
potential to the same species,

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,760
A, when it's pure, the same
temperature, the same

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:15,590
pressure, what I want to argue
is that the chemical potential

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:17,830
in the mixture is always less
than the chemical potential

30
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,650
when it's pure.

31
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,230
The same conditions of pressure
and temperature.

32
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,380
And, so we can do a little
thought experiment.

33
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,540
Let's do a little thought
experiment.

34
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:32,140
Let's make a box, and
in our box we're

35
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:40,410
going to have a partition.

36
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,540
And a flexible membrane here.

37
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,350
And on one side of the partition
we're going to have

38
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,760
a gas, B. A gas, A,
on this side here.

39
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,730
And gas A on this side here.

40
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:03,630
So let me just red chalk for
A, And I don't think I have

41
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,670
any other colors listed.

42
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:08,150
Yellow chalk for B here.

43
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,850
And everything's one bar.

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,700
Everything's one bar.

45
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,520
So one bar B here.

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,160
One bar A here, one
bar A here .

47
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:25,980
And this membrane here
only lets A through.

48
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,240
And this membrane is deformable,
but it's elastic.

49
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,440
You can't deform it forever.

50
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
It has some strength
to it, right?

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,360
So if you push on,
it'll push back.

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,350
There'll be pressure associated
with that.

53
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,180
So the next thing I do, then,
in my experiment, shouldn't

54
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,010
have done it here.

55
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:45,660
Next thing I do in my experiment
is to break this

56
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,940
partition here.

57
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm going to break
the partition.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,550
And this will cause
A and B to mix.

59
00:03:55,550 --> 00:04:07,760
So now in my box I have my
partition, my membrane here.

60
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,910
I've got A at one bar here,
total pressure of one bar.

61
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,970
And on the other side I have A
plus B, with a total pressure

62
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:28,450
of one bar.

63
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,170
That's my initial point now.

64
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,840
What's going to happen?

65
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,860
What's going to happen is that
molecules of A here are going

66
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,950
to want to go through
the membrane to go

67
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:40,910
in this area here.

68
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,230
And there's two ways
to look at it.

69
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,090
You can look at it the
thermodynamic way, which is

70
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,370
the way that we're going to
want to be looking at it.

71
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,460
Which is that, from what we're
going to prove, is that the

72
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,610
chemical potential in the
mixture is always less than

73
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,900
for the pure substance.

74
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,600
Here we have a mixture.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,280
One bar.

76
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,290
Here we have the pure substance
at one bar.

77
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,350
So these molecules are going
to look around and say hey,

78
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:03,680
you know, I'm much
happier here.

79
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,570
And they're all going to want
to go in this area here.

80
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,000
As a result, the volume of this
area, if you want to keep

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,310
the same pressure on both sides,
you're going to deform

82
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,440
the membrane.

83
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,530
The membrane's going
to get deformed.

84
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,590
It's going to bloat
on that side here.

85
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,750
It's going to cause
an increase in

86
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,280
pressure on that side.

87
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,210
And the increase in pressure
from the membrane sort of

88
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:31,600
deforming and pushing back, is
going to increase until the

89
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,160
partial pressure of A, here,
equals the pressure of A here.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,980
At which point the flow of A
from either side is going to

91
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,550
be the same and you're going
to be in equilibrium.

92
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,180
And at that point the chemical
potentials of both sides are

93
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,460
going to be the same.

94
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,700
So I sort of gave you the other
way of looking at it.

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,580
Which is just purely in
terms of pressures.

96
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:57,650
At equilibrium, the partial
pressure of A here has to be

97
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,630
the same as the pressure
on this side here.

98
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,000
So that the flow of A on either
side of that membrane,

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,580
going from right to left or
left to right is the same.

100
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,960
And that's going to cause
this mixing to happen.

101
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,940
If you look at it from partial
pressure perspective.

102
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,610
But really, it's a chemical
potential idea.

103
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,890
Now, the chemical potential,
as we saw, was

104
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,280
the Gibbs free energy.

105
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,990
And the Gibbs free energy, you
can write it as H minus TS.

106
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:32,410
So basically, in this process
that I described, the

107
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:33,730
enthalpy's not doing anything.

108
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,730
These are ideal gases.

109
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,370
They're not interacting
with each other.

110
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,980
The only thing that's changing,
that's driving the

111
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,650
chemical potential, which is
basically Gibbs free energy

112
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,310
per mole, the only thing that's
driving the chemical

113
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,850
potential to be lower on
this side here, is

114
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,440
that entropy term.

115
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,690
It's the entropy of mixing.

116
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,790
So entropy of mixing is really
super important.

117
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,650
When we're talking about
systems where you have

118
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,910
multiple components.

119
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,470
That's going to drive
a lot of things.

120
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,350
And in fact that's going to
drive equilibrium, as we're

121
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,310
going to see a little
bit later today.

122
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,100
Alright, let's quickly
go through the math

123
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,370
and prove this here.

124
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:23,660
So our goal, then, is to have a
mixture, chemical potential

125
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,710
of the mixture on one side, and
the chemical potential of

126
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,310
the pure material on
the other side.

127
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,990
And so we're going to start by
sort of a similar thing here.

128
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,090
We're going to have a box, let
me redo my box here, we're

129
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,080
going to have a box with,
let me get rid of

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,490
these one bars here.

131
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,750
We're going to put our
membrane in the box.

132
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,590
And we're going to have
a pressure, pA,

133
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,250
on this side here.

134
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,470
And we're going to have a
pressure pA prime for the

135
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,790
partial pressure of A. And pB
prime for the partial pressure

136
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:12,130
of B. And the p total is going
to be pA prime plus pB prime.

137
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,030
And I'm going to see at
equilibrium, I'm going to

138
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:17,890
write everything I know
about equilibrium.

139
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:21,470
At equilibrium, I know that the
partial pressure of A on

140
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,530
that side here has to be equal
to the pressure of A here.

141
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,100
The partial pressure, the
pressure is basically the

142
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,130
force of these molecules hitting
that membrane per unit

143
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:35,280
time, times the number
of molecules hitting.

144
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,110
So we have the same flux of
molecules going this way, is

145
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,720
equal to the flux of molecules
going the other way.

146
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:50,180
So at equilibrium, pA
prime equals pA.

147
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,860
So.

148
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,060
What else can I say?

149
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,980
At equilibrium, in terms of
the chemical potentials, I

150
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,430
know that the chemical potential
of the mixture, mu A

151
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,470
in the mixture, temperature
under pressure p total.

152
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,740
Is equal to the chemical
potential of the pure system,

153
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,570
same temperature under
pressure is p

154
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,850
sub a on that side.

155
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,250
These are the two things that
I know at equilibrium.

156
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,260
So let's start to
turn the crank.

157
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,150
And see if we can come up
with, well, we basically

158
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:30,320
already have this.

159
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,180
If we can massage the right side
of our equation so that

160
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:39,480
the pressure term,
pA, is p total.

161
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:45,690
And then we'll have an equation
that will compare the

162
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,320
chemical potential of the
mixture under the same

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,740
conditions as the chemical
potential of

164
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:54,030
A in the pure state.

165
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,590
So, what can we use?

166
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:01,600
We can use Dalton's law here,
which tells us that pA prime

167
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,380
is equal to xA p total.

168
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,700
That's from Dalton.

169
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,780
And now, pA prime
is equal to pA.

170
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,710
So this is also just pA.

171
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:18,780
And we can plug that in here,
and suddenly we've got p total

172
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,450
included in here.

173
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:25,630
Let's just pass these out.

174
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:30,160
If you want to, thank you.

175
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:40,450
Thank you.

176
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:50,820
So, this is equal to mu A pure
temperature xA p total.

177
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,730
So what else do I know?

178
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,280
I know that I've written
something here, that mu is

179
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,610
equal to mu naught, to temp,
so this is at one bar.

180
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:02,660
RT log p.

181
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:11,960
So I'm going to rewrite
this as mu A pure

182
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,230
temperature T at one bar.

183
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,940
Plus RT log xA p total.

184
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,340
Now, the log of xA times p total
is the log of xA plus

185
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,220
the log of p total.

186
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:34,240
It's equal to plus RT log
p total plus RT log xA.

187
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,470
So I can lump these two
things together.

188
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,650
I have mu A pure T
plus RT log p.

189
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:52,480
Well, that's just the chemical
potential of A, in the pure

190
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,520
state, at temperature
T and pressure pT.

191
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,220
That's the equation here to
relate pressure, at some

192
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,650
variable pressure p, to what
it would be at one bar.

193
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,170
Which is that.

194
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,640
Then we have the plus RT
log xA sitting here.

195
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,490
Plus RT log xA.

196
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,310
So we're done.

197
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:16,820
We're done because on that side
here I have mu A, the

198
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:21,600
chemical potential of A in the
mixture, temperature T,

199
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,220
pressure p total.

200
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,270
I've got mu A pure temperature
T pressure p

201
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,530
total, plus a term.

202
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:32,420
Plus RT log xA.

203
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,100
Can xA be bigger than one? xA's
the mole fraction. xA's

204
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,150
always less than one.

205
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,050
Log xA is always
less than zero.

206
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:48,920
This term here is always less
than or equal to zero.

207
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,870
Therefore, this term is always
less than that term.

208
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,850
Therefore the chemical potential
in the mixture is

209
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,950
always less than the
chemical potential

210
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:09,320
inside the pure material.

211
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,660
This is going to be important
for the next part of the

212
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,010
presentation.

213
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:17,230
Any questions?

214
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,985
This is what drives the death
of saltwater fish in fresh

215
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:22,250
water, right?

216
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,500
Because osmotic pressure
is basically given by

217
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,010
this basic idea here.

218
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:38,050
And it's all driven by
entropy of mixing.

219
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:38,960
Sure you don't have
any questions?

220
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:44,740
Speak up.

221
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,810
So now we have all the tools
we need to look at chemical

222
00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:53,070
equilibrium.

223
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:57,250
When we have a mixture, and
we're going to start with

224
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,080
ideal gases.

225
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:01,550
But everything I'm going to
say about equilibrium and

226
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:05,700
ideal gases is valid
for solutions.

227
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,220
An ideal gas, and we're
going to be

228
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,580
talking about ideal solutions.

229
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,500
And molecules in an ideal
solution, an ideal solvent,

230
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,680
are not very different than
molecules in an ideal gas.

231
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,320
They don't interact
with each other.

232
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,190
You use concentration instead
of partial pressures, but

233
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,810
pretty much all the ideas
are the same.

234
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:22,035
All the concepts are the same.

235
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:24,170
The equations are basically
the same.

236
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,110
You just do a little bit of
replacement of variables.

237
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,800
But it pretty much is
the same thing.

238
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,810
It's easier to think about it,
to learn first in terms of the

239
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,830
ideal gas, but it applies
equally well to what you're

240
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,840
more likely to use.

241
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,040
Which is solutions.

242
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,180
So let's look at the
prototypical gas phase

243
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:51,900
reaction that everybody writes
down when they first do this

244
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,580
sort of problems.

245
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,980
The Haber process.

246
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:59,310
Gas, temperature T,
you take nitrogen.

247
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:05,940
You react it with hydrogen,
gas, temperature T, p.

248
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,200
And you make ammonia.

249
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,740
NH3 gas T, p.

250
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:18,900
And we're going to ask the
question, so I take nitrogen,

251
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,470
I take some, hydrogen, I mix
them together in a container.

252
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,710
And I make ammonia.

253
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:27,340
And I'm going to ask, after I
reach equilibrium, what is the

254
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:36,810
partial pressure of nitrogen
hydrogen and ammonia?

255
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,320
Standard equilibrium problem.

256
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,740
You all, I'm sure you've all
seen equations about

257
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,560
equilibrium.

258
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,460
Equilibrium constant K, log
delta G of the reaction, et

259
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,700
cetera, et cetera.

260
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:51,330
But you probably don't have a
really good intuition as to

261
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,350
why it is what it is.

262
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:59,100
So the point of the class here
is not to relearn log K is

263
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,880
equal to minus delta G, reaction
divided by RT.

264
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,150
The point is to learn
how we get there.

265
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,260
How we get to that equation.

266
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,480
And what parts are important.

267
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,130
Specifically, how entropy of
mixing really becomes key to

268
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,170
equilibrium.

269
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,260
But before we get there, let
me give you a little bit of

270
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,340
history as to why this is such
an important reaction.

271
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:25,870
This reaction, which you see in
every chemistry class, was

272
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,360
developed by Mr. Haber
and Mr. Bosch.

273
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:33,410
Mr. Bosch made it large-scale
around 1910.

274
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:38,210
And it's the reaction that you
use to make fertilizer.

275
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,550
Ammonia is the feed stock
to make nitrogen-based

276
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,430
fertilizers.

277
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,780
So today, there are a hundred
million tons of fertilizer, of

278
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,930
nitrogen fertilizer
made, using,

279
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,200
essentially, the Haber process.

280
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,820
It's a huge, huge, commodity.

281
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,520
1% of the world's energy
is taken up

282
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,640
to make this reaction.

283
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,750
Almost 1% is about 3/4
of the world's

284
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:06,510
energy is used on this.

285
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:12,120
In World War 1, Germany was
making explosives out of

286
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
nitrogen feed stock.

287
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,060
And it was getting its feed
stock from Chile.

288
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,530
From saltpeter mines in Chile.

289
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:21,160
Chile was under British
hands at the time.

290
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,590
Well, the British didn't
let Chile sell

291
00:17:24,590 --> 00:17:26,220
saltpeter to Germany.

292
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:30,190
Germany had to find another
way to make ammunitions.

293
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,210
And the Haber process, which
had just been invented by

294
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:43,900
Bosch-Haber, became the way that
Germany made explosives.

295
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:48,700
Without this, Germany would have
stopped the war in 1916.

296
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,580
Or even before then.

297
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:55,170
Way before then.

298
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:03,460
And this process was basically,
and Haber and Bosch

299
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,020
got the Nobel Prize,
essentially, for this process.

300
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,390
For showing how to take
chemistry, and doing chemistry

301
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,870
and large scale processes under
high pressure and high

302
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:12,180
temperature conditions.

303
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,130
Haber got the Nobel Prize in
1918 and Bosch got it in 1931.

304
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,300
This process, arguably, you
could say, was the birth of

305
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,720
the dominance of Germany
as a chemical industry.

306
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,360
Based on that, and the fact that
they had to make liquid

307
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,940
fuels out of coal.

308
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,750
The syn-gas, or the
syn-fuel process.

309
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,200
Also invented during World War
1, where they had to use, they

310
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,060
couldn't find any oil and they
had to use their coal mines.

311
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,960
And obviously this process,
the syn-fuel process, is

312
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,480
coming back in vogue with the
energy crisis around now.

313
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,770
So they developed a lot of
knowledge about how to do

314
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,090
large-scale chemical
reactions.

315
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,400
And that was the birth of, or
the explosion of, companies

316
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,210
like Merck and Bayer and Bosch,
and BASF, and all these

317
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,860
German companies that dominate,
basically, the

318
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,870
chemical industry.

319
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:18,480
And when Germany lost the war,
the US government confiscated

320
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,390
the American divisions of
these German companies.

321
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:26,950
And I'm sure you've heard
of Merck as the company.

322
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,610
And you think of Merck
as an American

323
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,930
company that makes drugs.

324
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:31,720
Well, that's true.

325
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,240
It's a very large American
company that makes drugs.

326
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,110
But there's another Merck, which
is the German Merck.

327
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,610
Which also makes drugs.

328
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,760
But it makes liquid crystals.

329
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,092
And liquid crystals is
where it makes all of

330
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:45,110
its money right now.

331
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,410
And it's very confusing because
they're both Merck.

332
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:52,040
And they both came from the
Merck family from the 1600s

333
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,470
that were pharmacists.

334
00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:02,420
But after World War 1, Merck
Germany was allowed to use the

335
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,060
name Merck everywhere in the
world except for the US.

336
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,980
In the US it's called EMD.

337
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,380
Merck USA is allowed to use the
name Merck in the US and

338
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,820
outside of the US it's called,
let me remind myself, it's

339
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,460
called MSD.

340
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,840
It's very confusing.

341
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,850
Bayer is the same way.

342
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,560
So Bayer was split up.

343
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:26,260
And there was Buyer in Germany
and there was Bayer in the US.

344
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,570
You've got Bayer Aspirin
from the US term Bayer.

345
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:31,550
And you've got all the other

346
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:33,770
pharmaceuticals from Bayer Germany.

347
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,040
All the chemicals.

348
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,450
And a few years ago, Buyer
bought Bayer, and now we have

349
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:44,750
one Buyer-Bayer, depending
on where you live.

350
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,060
And so it's very interesting
to see the history of all

351
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,240
these big chemical companies.

352
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,690
And that's why Switzerland and
Germany are still the home of,

353
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,390
it's all due to that reaction.

354
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,470
That's why you always
see that reaction.

355
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:58,520
Fertilizers, at the birth of the
chemical company, and it's

356
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:06,260
a great example for
equilibrium.

357
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,760
So that's the example.

358
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,680
Let's generalize it.

359
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,250
We're actually not going
to work on this

360
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,300
until the very end.

361
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,940
And we'll see it again.

362
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,040
But let's generalize.

363
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,480
Let's just take a mixture of
gases with stoichiometries nu

364
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:27,970
A, a gas, pressure, temperature
plus nu B, B, gas,

365
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:35,946
pressure, temperature, goes to
nu sub C moles of C, it's a

366
00:21:35,946 --> 00:21:38,930
gas, with a temperature and
pressure, plus nu sub D moles

367
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,620
of D, which is a gas,
temperature, pressure.

368
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,610
All ideal gases.

369
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:48,430
For now.

370
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:57,100
So this the setup here.

371
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:04,730
Now, when we write that reaction
up here, what we're

372
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:11,930
really writing is, in terms
of the process, is take a

373
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:16,630
container that contains A, plus
a container that contains

374
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:21,950
B, and go to a container that
contains C, plus a container

375
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:28,970
that contains D. And when we
write delta G for that

376
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,000
reaction here, the process that
we're talking about is

377
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,150
taking the reactions separately
from each other.

378
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,830
That's the initial state.

379
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,520
And the final state
is the product.

380
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,090
Separated in their own
containers from each other.

381
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,820
And when we say delta G is
less than zero, for this

382
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,770
process, which means it's
spontaneous, we mean the

383
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,300
process to go from the separated
reactions to the

384
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,000
separated products.

385
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,310
But in reality, that's not what
you do when you do an

386
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,050
experiment.

387
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,630
In reality, you take these
two containers and

388
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,020
you mix them together.

389
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,250
A plus B. And you
let that react.

390
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:14,790
And at the end of the day, you
have a big container with A

391
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:20,430
plus B plus C plus D inside,
all mixed up together in

392
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:23,190
equilibrium.

393
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,500
And this is not the
same as that.

394
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,030
It's not the same as that.

395
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:35,070
Because you've got
entropy of mixing

396
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:37,760
happening in all of this.

397
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,030
Forget about A and B interacting
with each other.

398
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,780
Entropy of mixing is going
to dominate equilibrium.

399
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:51,060
You've got this problem
to deal with.

400
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,310
So that means that we're going
to have to worry about, if

401
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:59,430
we're going to want to know at
which state the process is in

402
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,745
equilibrium, you're going to
have to worry about this issue

403
00:24:01,745 --> 00:24:03,020
right here.

404
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,470
It's not enough to know what
delta G of the reaction is.

405
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:10,920
So for instance, if I plot, as
function of the reaction, I've

406
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,810
got the reactants on
that side here.

407
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:18,830
And the products on
this side here.

408
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:22,570
And I want to plot delta G as
a function of the reaction.

409
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:28,190
Well, my initial delta G that
I would write, to calculate

410
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,050
delta G of the reaction, which
is the delta G of the

411
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:41,520
products, minus the delta G of
the reactants, so initially I

412
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,110
have delta G of the reactants.

413
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,610
That's, in those two boxes,
that aren't mixed.

414
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,930
So I'm up here somewhere.

415
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:55,470
Delta G of the reactants.

416
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:57,950
And at the end of the process,
in these two boxes, when I

417
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,500
calculate this delta G naught
reaction, I'm sitting

418
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,290
somewhere here.

419
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,590
Let's say it's a downhill
process.

420
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,480
Delta G naught of
the products.

421
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,900
Well, the first thing that
happens, when I take these two

422
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,760
boxes and mix them together,
is delta G naught of the

423
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,630
reaction's going to go
up or going to go

424
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,740
down, or stay the same.

425
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:24,480
Anybody want to guess?

426
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,030
When I go from here to here,
before there's any reaction

427
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:30,330
that happens.

428
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,570
Shall we vote?

429
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,580
How many say that it's
going to go down?

430
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:39,670
How many say that it's
going to go up?

431
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,830
How many say that it's going
to stay the same?

432
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:45,910
We have about three people that
said it's going to go up.

433
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:48,640
And a lot of people that say
it's going to go down.

434
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,850
And a few people that
are abstaining.

435
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:57,130
OK.

436
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,140
We're mixing things.

437
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,660
Anybody want to change
their votes?

438
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,170
Something is happening here.

439
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:08,730
And this entropy term here, when
A and B come together and

440
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:14,660
start mixing up.

441
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:15,680
You're changing your vote.

442
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,200
Alright.

443
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,610
It's going to go down.

444
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:21,380
Now we have near-unanimity.

445
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,850
So the first thing that
happens is, you're

446
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,140
going to go down here.

447
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,200
You're going to have delta
G naught of the

448
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,870
reactants in the mixture.

449
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,770
And if it were to go all the
way, if A and B were to

450
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:40,400
disappear, it still
would be mixed.

451
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,700
And so the end product here
would actually be down here.

452
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,110
It wouldn't be up
in the products.

453
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,890
It would be the mixture.

454
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,050
So that's the first
thing we know.

455
00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:52,160
That this delta G naught
reaction is

456
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,340
not the full story.

457
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,560
And along the way, here I have
two species to begin with.

458
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,140
I've got two species
to end with.

459
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,380
But I've got three different
species here in the middle.

460
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:12,150
So as soon as I form a little
bit of products, in this case

461
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:14,370
here, or if I start from
products and go the other way

462
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,000
in the reaction and form the
reactants, the first thing

463
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,770
that's going to happen is I'm
going to decrease the delta G.

464
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:22,510
Just from the entropy
of mixing.

465
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:27,940
And so if I plot my delta G
as a function of reaction

466
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:34,070
conditions, I'm going to get
a bowing curve like that.

467
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:38,050
If the entropy wasn't there,
then it would just be a

468
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,890
straight line from
one to the other.

469
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,660
The entropy of mixing
of reactants and

470
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:43,510
products wasn't there.

471
00:27:43,510 --> 00:27:45,170
Actually, let me
put it up here.

472
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:48,420
If entropy of mixing wasn't
there, I would

473
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,990
start from up here.

474
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,140
And as my stoichiometry changed,
I would have a linear

475
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,520
curve from here to there
as a function of

476
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,590
the process of reaction.

477
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:01,410
But the entropy of mixing is
causing my initial state and

478
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:02,750
my final state to go down.

479
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,010
And it's causing a
bow in this here.

480
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,330
Because if I have equal amounts
of A, B, C, and D,

481
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:12,400
that's a lot of entropy
of mixing there.

482
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,990
So equilibrium is actually
somewhere down here.

483
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,680
It's where delta G of the
mixture is at its lowest.

484
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:25,060
Delta G of the mixture
is at its lowest.

485
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:31,650
Any questions?

486
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:33,250
Now we going to do the math.

487
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:42,030
We're going to see how
that comes about.

488
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:52,510
Let me do it here.

489
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:55,780
So the question we're going to
ask is, suppose that I've got

490
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,910
my mixture here.

491
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:02,290
And I'm sitting somewhere
on this curve here.

492
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,240
So I've got pA for partial
pressure of A, partial

493
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,420
pressure of B, partial pressure
of C, and partial

494
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,640
pressure of D in my mixture.

495
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,470
And I want to know, I've
got this mixture of

496
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,760
reactants and products.

497
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,260
Which way is the reaction
going to go?

498
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,880
Is it going to go towards
the products?

499
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,420
Is it going to go towards
the reactants?

500
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,910
Or is it at equilibrium?

501
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:31,120
And to answer that question, I'm
going to let the reaction

502
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,200
react a little bit
more to create a

503
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,870
little bit more products.

504
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,930
Remove a little bit
of reactants.

505
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:42,500
And see what the sign of delta
G is for that process.

506
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:51,100
So I'm going to go from a moles
of A, b moles of B, c

507
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,720
moles of C and d moles of D in
my mixture, which is that

508
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,260
point on my graph here.

509
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,270
Partial pressure A, partial
pressure of B, partial

510
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:02,160
pressure of C, and partial
pressure D, and I'm going to

511
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:13,360
react it a little bit more. a
plus, a minus epsilon times nu

512
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,830
A, where epsilon is a
very small number.

513
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:25,000
Of A, b minus epsilon times nu
B times B. And I'm going to

514
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,520
have, now, products being
formed. c moles plus epsilon

515
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,020
times nu C, I've going to have
the stoichiometry in there.

516
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:37,870
For every nu A moles of A that I
lose, I create mu C moles of

517
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:42,550
C. Times epsilon as the
scaling factor.

518
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:48,340
And d plus epsilon times nu D
moles of D. That's going to be

519
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,240
my new mixture.

520
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,700
And I'm going to ask, as I go
from this initial state to

521
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,380
that final state, I'm sitting
on that curve, which sign is

522
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:01,300
delta G. How do I know what
the sign of delta G is?

523
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,470
What is delta G for
this process?

524
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,890
Not the reaction with the
isolated reactants and

525
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,390
products, but the
reaction where

526
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,870
everything is mixed together.

527
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,470
Where I'm going to have to
worry about the chemical

528
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:15,680
potentials of mixtures.

529
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:18,240
And I'm going to go from one
mixture to another mixture,

530
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,960
and that's going to be the key
to telling me if I'm in

531
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,420
equilibrium or not.

532
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,690
But we know how to do this.

533
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:28,050
We know how to do this.

534
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:35,330
So I want to calculate delta G
for the process is delta G

535
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:39,030
after minus delta G before.

536
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:46,340
That's delta G after minus
delta G before.

537
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:53,390
And I know that delta G, rather,
let's call it G after

538
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:59,330
minus G before, the Gibbs free
energy after minus the Gibbs

539
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:01,150
free energy before.

540
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,460
And I know the Gibbs free energy
is just the sum of the

541
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,600
chemical potentials, right?

542
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,550
You take all the species, and
you take all the chemical

543
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,070
potentials.

544
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,550
You add it up together times
the stoichiometry.

545
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,420
And that gives you the
Gibbs free energy.

546
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,820
That's what we learned
last time.

547
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,820
So if I want to find what the
Gibbs free energy at the end

548
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:22,840
here is, I look at the chemical
potentials of A, B,

549
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,080
and C and D times their
number of moles.

550
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,310
So I look at a minus epsilon
times nu A times the chemical

551
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:36,500
potential of A, plus b minus
epsilon times nu B times the

552
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,400
chemical potential of B plus
c, plus epsilon times nu C,

553
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:45,860
the chemical potential at C,
plus d, plus epsilon times nu

554
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:53,510
D, the chemical potential
of D.

555
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:59,660
And then I subtract
what G was before.

556
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:03,620
This infinitesimally
small process.

557
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:17,050
Was a times mu A plus b times mu
B plus c times mu C, plus d

558
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:25,150
times mu D. And we're assuming
that my small change, the

559
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,890
small amount of A and B that get
destroyed to form C and D

560
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,070
is small enough that the
chemical potential basically

561
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,270
stays the same during this
infinitesimally small change.

562
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:36,250
That's why I can use
the same chemical

563
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:41,260
potentials before and after.

564
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:44,150
OK, a lot of things drop out.

565
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,500
This term drops out
from that term.

566
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,060
This term drops out
from this term.

567
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,240
This term drops out
from this term.

568
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,060
This is a minus, no,
this is all plus.

569
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,880
That's fine.

570
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,240
There's the minus
sign right here.

571
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,990
So then this term drops
out from that term.

572
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:09,940
And I am left with epsilon times
nu C mu C, the chemical

573
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:16,970
potentials of the products minus
the sum of the chemical

574
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:29,790
potentials of the reactants,
nu A, mu A plus nu B mu B.

575
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:37,070
That's the delta G for
this small change.

576
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,030
Now, you remember way back,
maybe from even just last

577
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,980
semester if you've taken 5.112
last semester, or from last

578
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,770
year, or from high school, that
the partial pressure is

579
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:49,130
going to the equilibrium
constant.

580
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,420
Somehow we're going to
have to get partial

581
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,300
pressures in there.

582
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,170
But we know now how to
go from chemical

583
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:57,610
potentials to partial pressures.

584
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,500
It's written right here.

585
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,910
The chemical potentials of the,
and we also know how to

586
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:08,530
go from the chemical potential
in the mixed species, in the,

587
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,900
mixture to the chemical
potential in a pure.

588
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,150
We saw that mu A in the mixture,
temperature, pressure

589
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:24,710
was equal to mu A pure
temperature,

590
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:29,110
pressure plus RT log xA.

591
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,470
So those are things that we're
going to be using, to go from

592
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:35,150
something that has chemical
potential to something where

593
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:38,390
we'll be able to get back
pressures, partial pressures,

594
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,510
and delta G of the reaction,
because we're going to need

595
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:45,730
the chemical potential
of the pure stuff.

596
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,970
So let me go forward
just a little bit.

597
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:57,360
Remind you, if I look at the
delta G of the reaction, delta

598
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,360
G of the reaction, in terms
of chemical potentials.

599
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:04,630
Delta G naught of
the reaction.

600
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:09,970
This is the delta G of the
products minus the delta G of

601
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:13,610
the reactants when they're pure,
not when they're mixed.

602
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:24,900
So delta G naught of the
reaction is nu C mu C at one

603
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:34,200
bar pure plus nu D mu D pure.

604
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:45,740
Minus nu A mu A pure minus nu
B mu B in the pure state.

605
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,010
That's what delta G naught of
the reaction is in terms of

606
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,190
the chemical potentials
of all these species.

607
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:54,990
Everything's at one bar,
and everything is pure.

608
00:36:54,990 --> 00:37:06,360
Somehow this is going to have
to come out of this.

609
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,240
So let's keep going.

610
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:17,910
And see how it falls out.

611
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,595
So for each one of these
chemical potentials, I'm going

612
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:22,310
to write it in terms
of the pressure.

613
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,550
What I just covered up here.

614
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:33,290
Mu(T, p) is mu naught
of T times RT log p.

615
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:39,130
So now, delta G is going to be
equal to epsilon, and I'm

616
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:41,300
going to do a little
massaging quickly.

617
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:45,030
And I'll let you take this, go
home and see how I went from

618
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:45,910
one state to the other.

619
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:50,260
The secret is to put in here
the pressure dependence.

620
00:37:50,260 --> 00:38:05,480
Nu C mu C naught, plus nu D mu
D naught, minus nu A mu A

621
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:19,870
naught, plus nu B mu B naught,
plus RT log pC to the nu C, pD

622
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:28,820
to the nu D, divided by pA to
the nu A, pB to the nu B.

623
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:34,190
These log partial pressures all
come from expanding out

624
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:57,910
the chemical potential as
mu naught plus RT log p.

625
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:06,650
And then we recognize that this
part right here, this

626
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:16,250
part right here is delta
G naught reaction.

627
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:22,120
So I have delta G now, for
this process of taking

628
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,360
reactants to products just a
little bit, let me take it as

629
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,740
a function of epsilon here.

630
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:36,070
Delta G naught of the reaction
plus RT log of this ratio of

631
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,100
partial pressures.

632
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:41,410
I'm going to call that Q. I'm
going to call this thing here

633
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:44,480
Q, which you've seen before.

634
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:51,730
The reaction quotient.

635
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,050
And this tells me that for
this very small process,

636
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:03,310
epsilon, very small, if delta
G naught, delta G, of this

637
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:09,130
process, is less than zero, then
the reaction will keep

638
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,690
going forward.

639
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:12,090
It means that I'll be on the
side of the curve here.

640
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:15,720
I'm going to go down a little
bit. delta G naught is going

641
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,690
to be great, it's going
to be spontaneous.

642
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:20,630
I'm not in equilibrium.

643
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,810
I'm going to go towards
the products.

644
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:30,960
If delta G is equal to zero,
then I'm at the bottom of this

645
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,350
curve here.

646
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,210
I'm here.

647
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,570
If I go forward a little
bit, the slope is zero.

648
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:42,890
Delta G is zero, I'm
in equilibrium.

649
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:50,380
And if delta G is greater than
zero, then I'm going to back

650
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:54,800
to reactants, and I'm sitting,
then, on that part of the

651
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,320
curve here.

652
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,600
And if I try to make more
products I'm just going uphill

653
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,780
a little bit.

654
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:06,790
So now, I've done this
all for epsilon is

655
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,900
equal to very small.

656
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,490
What you usually find written in
books is where the epsilon

657
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:11,260
equals to one.

658
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,420
Basically taking one mole
of this process.

659
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,840
So you'll see it per-mole
of this reaction.

660
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,820
But it's the same idea.

661
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,140
It's the same thing.

662
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,560
And in fact it doesn't really
matter, because the quantity

663
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,710
that matters is this delta G
naught reactions plus RT log

664
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:30,900
Q. It's the sign of this
quantity here.

665
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,630
This epsilon is just an
arbitrary number.

666
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,040
I can pick it, really
whatever I want.

667
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:42,010
So it's the sign of this
thing that's important.

668
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:46,670
Let me go back.

669
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:50,680
So what you'll see, then, is
delta G is equal to delta G

670
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:58,030
naught reaction plus RT log Q.
Basically, taking epsilon is

671
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,790
going to zero.

672
00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:12,980
As determining where the
equilibrium is going to be.

673
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:20,570
OK, any questions?

674
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,810
All driven by entropy
of mixing.

675
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,350
Without entropy of mixing,
we would be sitting

676
00:42:26,350 --> 00:42:28,720
on this curve here.

677
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,350
Delta G naught of the reaction
would tell us that everything

678
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:33,170
should go to completion.

679
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:36,010
Things don't go to completion,
and that's a good thing.

680
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,940
Otherwise there would not
be life on Earth.

681
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:43,110
We're basically a set of
equilibria in a big membrane.

682
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,840
Which is our skin, right?

683
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,390
All these biochemical
cycles are in

684
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:47,460
equilibrium with each other.

685
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:49,330
And it's a complicated
process.

686
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:52,880
And it's all driven
by entropy.

687
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:55,570
Ultimately.

688
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,560
And other things, but entropy
is very important.

689
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,140
Alright, so equilibrium now.

690
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,060
Equilibrium is when we have this
delta G equal to zero.

691
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:10,520
That's when delta G naught of
the reaction equals RT log Q.

692
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,045
And at that point, we replace Q
with to equilibrium, and we

693
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:19,390
call that the equilibrium
constant.

694
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:21,940
And we're going to put a little
p here, because it's in

695
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:25,520
terms of the partial
pressures.

696
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:32,900
And it's equal to the partial
pressures of the products

697
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,980
raised to their stoichiometry.

698
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,560
And divided by the partial
pressures of the reactants,

699
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,390
raised to the power of
their stoichiometry.

700
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,380
And this, you've seen
before, I'm sure.

701
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:54,140
At equilibrium.

702
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:58,130
And there's a minus sign
somewhere here.

703
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:00,730
Because it's this plus that
that's equal to zero, and

704
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:04,160
there's the minus sign that
I forgot to write down.

705
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,120
So we define, then, equilibrium
constant this way.

706
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:15,370
And one of the things to note is
that Kp as written here is

707
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:16,340
actually unitless.

708
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:18,310
It doesn't look like it.

709
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,680
The way that I've written it.

710
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,670
Because I did a shorthand way of
writing the pressures, when

711
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:33,400
I wrote RT log p here.

712
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,560
There's the assumption, when
you have the log of the

713
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:39,450
pressure, that there's always
one bar sitting behind there.

714
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:40,370
Underneath.

715
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:43,080
It's always referenced to
a reference pressure.

716
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,990
There's always a reference
pressure. p naught dividing it

717
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:51,120
by, because you don't want to
have any units inside the log.

718
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,410
And this reference pressure,
we took as one bar.

719
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:57,010
And it's pretty common to just
ignore the fact that you've

720
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,940
got one bar sitting in
the denominator.

721
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,760
And so, actually, all these
pressures here are divided by

722
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,720
p reference divided by p
reference, divided by p

723
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,590
reference, divided by
p reference, which

724
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:15,740
happens to be 1 bar.

725
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,450
But it's there.

726
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:20,200
And that means that the bars
on top and the bars on the

727
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,030
bottom cancel out.

728
00:45:22,030 --> 00:45:25,790
Which means that K sub p
doesn't have any units.

729
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,040
It is unitless.

730
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,640
It's a number.

731
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,200
Straight number.

732
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,880
Very common mistake to make,
to write it and forget that

733
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:37,530
there's one bar sitting
on the bottom here.

734
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:40,440
And you take all the bars to the
new powers on top, and the

735
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,350
bars to the new powers
on the bottom.

736
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:45,450
And make units there.

737
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:49,090
And get Kp is equal to some
number, to the, times bar to

738
00:45:49,090 --> 00:45:49,960
some power.

739
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:54,550
That would be wrong.

740
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,920
I know I've made that
mistake before.

741
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,750
But you are not going to make
that mistake, right?

742
00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:01,720
Because you've been warned.

743
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:03,280
That this is a common mistake.

744
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,810
This is unitless.

745
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:11,270
Now, you can invert this to get
Kp as a function of delta

746
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:16,750
G. e to the minus delta
G naught of the

747
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,380
reaction divided by RT.

748
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,980
And those are the things that
you use to go back and forth

749
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,240
between the thermodynamic
quantities, like G that you

750
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,440
calculate, to equilibrium
quantities like the K, to

751
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,610
finding equilibria
between something

752
00:46:34,610 --> 00:46:36,830
like the Haber process.

753
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:39,840
Now, there's other equilibrium
constant that is used a lot.

754
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,200
Which is the form of the
equilibrium constant not in

755
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,800
terms of the partial pressures,
but in terms of the

756
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,920
mole fraction.

757
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,950
That's also an important one
when you're looking at

758
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,290
solution cases.

759
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:56,800
Because we can rewrite the
partial pressures using

760
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:03,610
Dalton's law. pC is equal to the
mole fraction of species C

761
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:06,850
times the total pressure,
I'll call it p.

762
00:47:06,850 --> 00:47:09,710
So if I replace every one of
these partial pressures using

763
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:19,120
Dalton's law, I get K sub p is
equal to xC pC times p to the

764
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:30,710
nu C, times xD pD to the nu D,
divided by xA pA - no, not pA,

765
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,150
total pressure.

766
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:33,350
Dalton's law.

767
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:39,550
To the nu A, xB p to the nu B.

768
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:42,930
OK, so I've got p, p, p, p.

769
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:44,420
They all come out.

770
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,240
And that's p to the
minus delta nu.

771
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,230
Where delta nu is the difference
in the number of

772
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:55,370
moles of reactants minus the
number of moles of products.

773
00:47:55,370 --> 00:48:06,710
So delta nu is nu C plus nu D
minus nu A minus nu B. It's

774
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:10,540
the moles of products minus
moles of reactants.

775
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:16,900
And then I have xA to the nu A,
xC to the nu C, xD to the

776
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:26,560
nu D, xA to the nu A, xB to
the nu B. And that ratio,

777
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,170
which is in terms of mole
fractions, we call K sub x.

778
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:32,680
The mole fractions.

779
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,380
Because p, to the minus
delta nu, times Kx.

780
00:48:40,430 --> 00:48:44,700
Now, this was unitless.

781
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,430
This pressure to the minus delta
nu sitting here, this

782
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:50,900
has bars to the minus
delta nu.

783
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:53,420
Kx has units.

784
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,420
It may not look like it because
it's a bunch of mole

785
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:58,840
fractions, and it certainly
doesn't look

786
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,830
like it has any units.

787
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:11,250
Mole fractions or ratio,
but it's got units.

788
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:20,790
So let's rewrite Kx
in terms of Kp.

789
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:28,090
Rewrite Kx as equal to p to the
minus delta nu, K sub p.

790
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:34,240
And the units are in terms of
bars, let's say, bar to the

791
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,670
minus delta nu.

792
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,890
Always want to check your units
at the end of the day.

793
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:41,710
If your units don't work
out after you've done a

794
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:48,950
calculation, you're
in trouble.

795
00:49:48,950 --> 00:49:49,710
Any questions?

796
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,490
Because we're going to
end today, at here.

797
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:51,830
Yes.

798
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:57,070
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

799
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,680
PROFESSOR: In the
notes it says Kp

800
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,030
and Kx are both unitless.

801
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,970
That is a mistake.

802
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,480
I'm going to fix that, and
put it on the Web.

803
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,050
So it may be that there's a
special case where the number

804
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:12,140
of moles before and after
are the same.

805
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,370
But generally that
is not true.

806
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:19,390
Where did I say that?

807
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:21,590
Oh, yeah.

808
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:24,600
Both unitless.

809
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:37,420
Well, that is actually true.

810
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,570
Let me think through this.

811
00:50:38,570 --> 00:50:42,410
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

812
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:43,900
PROFESSOR: About one bar,
one bar, one bar.

813
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,630
That is actually true.

814
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:49,270
They're both, that is true.

815
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:53,750
They are both unitless.

816
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,460
Well, this is a big boob
on my part here.

817
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,960
Because you are absolutely
right.

818
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:01,280
Because there's one bar sitting
here. one bar, one

819
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,720
bar, one bar, one bar, and
the bars cancel out.

820
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:08,850
Good catch.

821
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,250
OK, the notes are right.

822
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:13,060
My notes are right.

823
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:14,500
Alright.

824
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,440
Next time we'll talk about the
temperature dependence and the

825
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,260
pressure dependence of
equilibrium constants.
