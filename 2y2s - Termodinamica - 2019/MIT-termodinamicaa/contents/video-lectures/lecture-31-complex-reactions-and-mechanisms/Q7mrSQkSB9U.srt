8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,180
PROFESSOR: OK.

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,410
So last time you started
kinetics which is a completely

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,640
different topic from
thermodynamics.

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,570
They're related and we'll see a
relationship at some point.

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,980
And you did first
order kinetics.

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,550
And today we're going to move
on and go ahead and do more

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,190
complicated kinetics and
hopefully get to some

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,890
interesting stuff in
a couple lectures.

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,080
Right now we just have to do
the review of stuff that

17
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:51,100
you've probably seen before.

18
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,680
And so we're going to
go reasonably fast.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,140
So you saw first order
reactions.

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,870
Today we're going to do second
order reactions.

21
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,440
At least begin with second
order reactions.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,980
Second order kinetics.

23
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,720
Of the form, and then
there are two kinds.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:21,410
There's first order, rather,
second order, in one reactant

25
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:26,900
of the form A goes
to products.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,700
And then you have first order
in two reactants first order

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,980
in two reactants.

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:44,850
So I'll have the form A plus
B goes of products.

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,960
Where that's first order in A
and first order in B, and this

30
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,640
is second order in A. So you can
think of this as A plus A

31
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,210
goes to products if you want.

32
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:56,070
And there's some rate
constant k,

33
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,860
associated with this reaction.

34
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,380
And we do the rate analysis.

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,330
We write the rate
of this process.

36
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,580
Minus dA/dt.

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,440
And for the purpose of writing
on the board, and you might

38
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,030
want to do this also in
your homework, when

39
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,320
you're tired of writing.

40
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,130
I'm going to skip
the brackets.

41
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,040
The little brackets that we
usually put for concentration.

42
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm going to skip those, because
it's just too much

43
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,125
work to write them.

44
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:30,510
And you can understand that A
is a concentration of A. So

45
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,250
this is equal to k A squared.

46
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,490
Second order on A. And the units
for k, it's important to

47
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,280
keep track of your units, at the
end of the calculations,

48
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,030
often you want to make sure
your units work out.

49
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,730
So the units for k are going
to be of this, A is

50
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:50,400
in moles per liter.

51
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,600
The units for k, you're going
to have to be able to match

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,200
the units on this side here.

53
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,070
So the units for k are going to
be liters squared per mole

54
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,960
squared per second.

55
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,830
To make the units match.

56
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,140
Then you integrate this, on both
sides, from zero to t, or

57
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:18,630
from A0, the initial rate, to A.
Or from zero to t and this

58
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:22,180
doesn't go like this.

59
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:32,470
So integrate with A0 to A.
You've got dA over A squared,

60
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:35,520
you put all the A's on one side,
all the t's on the other

61
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,160
side, from zero to t dt with a
minus k on this side here.

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:50,420
And then you get your rate
equation, integrated rate

63
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,630
equation for this.

64
00:03:52,630 --> 00:04:01,240
Which gives you one over A is
equal to kt plus one over A0.

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,600
So this gives you A as
a function of time.

66
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,610
And this is a convenient way
to write it, because it's

67
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,410
linear in time.

68
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:09,650
So you always try to get things
to be linear in time.

69
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:15,360
Because then you can plot
them as a straight line.

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,460
Plot on this axis here you plot
one over A. on this axis

71
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:25,650
here you plot t as a
function of time.

72
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:34,420
And then you get a straight
line where the slope is k.

73
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,460
Gives you the rate, and the
intercept is one over A0.

74
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:39,720
Yes.

75
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:45,450
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

76
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:51,030
PROFESSOR: k is moles per liter
squared per second.

77
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,760
You're right, liters per
mole per second, yes.

78
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:03,880
That is correct. because
it has to work.

79
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
Otherwise it doesn't work.

80
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,860
So I need to turn on my brain.

81
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,530
OK, think.

82
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:15,250
Liters per mole per second.

83
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:24,630
Thank you.

84
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,210
And the other thing that you
want to know is the half-life.

85
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,050
What is the half-life.

86
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,030
So you set 2 A0.

87
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,600
So A0 over two, you look for the
time where you get to A0

88
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,310
over two, so you put A0
over two in here.

89
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,110
And that's going to be equal
to k times t 1/2

90
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,270
plus one over A0.

91
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,490
So you solve for the half-life
and you get a half-life

92
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:57,590
of one over k A0.

93
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:00,520
So the half-life is inversely
proportional to the amount of

94
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,820
stuff you started out with.

95
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Unlike the first order reaction,
where the half-life

96
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:14,010
was independent of the amount
that you started out with.

97
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,680
So this was the easy one.

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,760
The next one is a little
bit more complicated.

99
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:27,270
Which is when your first order
in each of two reactants.

100
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,500
Then your rate, your
differential rate equation,

101
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,320
looks like this.

102
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:36,240
Because the k times A times B,
and now you don't know what to

103
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,960
do with B, a priori.

104
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,740
So you want to rewrite this
equation a little bit

105
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:47,350
differently in terms of the
amount of A that's used up.

106
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,740
So you define A, x is equal to
A0 minus A, this is the amount

107
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,070
of A that's used up.

108
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,120
This is what you started
out with, this is

109
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,990
what you're left with.

110
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,440
And so the difference is
what's being used up.

111
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,050
And dx/dt is minus dA/dt.

112
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:15,180
And by stoichiometry, what
you've used up, of A, is also

113
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:19,310
what you've used up of B.
Because for every A that

114
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:25,575
reacts, you have to use up one
mole of B. For every mole of A

115
00:07:25,575 --> 00:07:28,510
that reacts, you use up one
mole of B. And so you also

116
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:34,780
have x to B0 minus B. So, you
can plug this in here.

117
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:37,420
And get a differential equation
which is purely in

118
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,450
terms of one variable,
which is x.

119
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,480
Right here, it looks like it's
in terms of two variables,

120
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,730
which makes it complicated.

121
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:46,160
By doing this change of
variables, you see that A and

122
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,370
B actually related.

123
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,150
Because of the reaction
stoichiometry.

124
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:59,010
So you can rewrite that as dx/dt
is equal to k times A0

125
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,230
minus x times B0 minus x.

126
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:05,210
And now you have a differential
equation in one

127
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,170
variable, which with some
tricks you can solve.

128
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,350
So we want to have the
integrated equation.

129
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,540
So we take an integral
of both sides.

130
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,560
We put in all the
x's on one side.

131
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,500
All the times on
the other side.

132
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:28,670
We'll go from x equals zero to
x, dx, A0 minus x times B0

133
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,920
minus x is equal to k
from zero to t dt.

134
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,990
And now you have to dig back
into the last time you took

135
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,830
integration calculus, which
for me was about

136
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:44,600
two centuries ago.

137
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,450
And figure out how to do
this integral here.

138
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:51,430
And the trick for doing
this integral is

139
00:08:51,430 --> 00:09:01,640
to use partial fractions.

140
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,510
So you use partial fractions
to do this integral here.

141
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:13,890
Which means that if you take
this ratio, one over A0 minus

142
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:20,570
x times B0 minus x and rewrite
it as some number, n1 divided

143
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:29,200
by A0 minus x, plus some number
n2 divided by B0 minus

144
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:35,210
x, you solve for n1 and n2, and
you find that n1 here is

145
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:43,600
equal to one over B0 minus
A0 and n2 is minus one

146
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,930
over B0 minus A0.

147
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,840
And so you plug, now,
this in here.

148
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,250
And instead of having this
complicated denominator, you

149
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,560
have a sum of two integrals
that you know how to do.

150
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,690
Because they're basically
of the form one over x.

151
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,410
And in doing this, you also
realize that you have to be

152
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:06,870
careful because when A0 is equal
to B0, when you have the

153
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:09,930
same amount of A and B,
then things blow up

154
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:10,770
and you're in trouble.

155
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,980
So that's going to be
a special case.

156
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,790
So always look out for special
cases for these things.

157
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:23,450
So you assume, then, that B0
is not the same as A0.

158
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,800
And then you can go forward
with solving it.

159
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,510
So you integrate, and at the
end of the process, I'm not

160
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:33,620
going to go through it, it's
really complicated, you get

161
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,520
something that looks
like this.

162
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:46,420
A0 minus B0 log of A B0 over
A0 B. And you have your

163
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:46,980
equation here.

164
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,660
Now, we don't really have a good
way to plot it against

165
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,350
one variable.

166
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,970
And the usual thing is look
at specific cases.

167
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,340
And limiting cases.

168
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,160
And there's one limiting case
we already brought up.

169
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,340
Which is when you started with
the same amount of material.

170
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,650
What does it look like if you
have the same amount of

171
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:06,830
material to begin with?

172
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,200
So if you have A0 equal to B0,
you start out with the same

173
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,680
amount of stuff, but if you
start out with the same amount

174
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,310
of stuff, then this doesn't
look so different from, at

175
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:21,260
least mathematically, from
this one right here.

176
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,570
If you start out with A0 is
equal to B0, and for every

177
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,345
mole of A that you use up you
use a mole of B, then

178
00:11:27,345 --> 00:11:30,560
throughout the whole reaction,
the concentration of A and the

179
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,480
concentration of B are
going to be the same.

180
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,010
So for the whole reaction, if
you started with this, A is

181
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,290
equal to B for all times.

182
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,000
That makes it easy.

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,030
Because now you can go back and
instead of writing A times

184
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,320
B, you can write A times A,
which is A squared, which is

185
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:47,890
what we had here.

186
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,870
And then you have the
whole thing solved.

187
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:57,150
So in that case here you just
have minus dA/dt is equal to k

188
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:06,610
A squared, and one over A is
equal to kt plus one over A0.

189
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,430
You don't even have to do any
math, you just look at it.

190
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:10,790
So that's one case.

191
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:14,340
Another case is if one of the
reactants is in much higher

192
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,380
concentration than the
other reactant.

193
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,180
And that's called flooding.

194
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,960
You basically flood the system
with one reactant.

195
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,670
And that's something that we'll
use again, hopefully by

196
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,710
the end of class today.

197
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,740
Let's say that we take, so this
is another limiting case.

198
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,860
Let's say we take A0 to be
much bigger than B0.

199
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,010
So we flood the system
with A0.

200
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:45,550
As a result, the concentration
of A doesn't change

201
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,470
very much in my pot.

202
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,260
It's hugely concentrated
in A, there's a

203
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,190
little bit of B around.

204
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,150
Again, with the process.

205
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,600
If I use all of the B up, the
difference in A is going to be

206
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,850
very small.

207
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,840
So at the end of the process,
I'm basically still going to

208
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,240
have A0 left in the pot.

209
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,230
So during the whole process,
during the whole time period,

210
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,280
I might as well assume that
A is equal to A0.

211
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,650
And that makes my life
much easier.

212
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,850
Because now if I write my
differential equation in terms

213
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:24,950
of B instead of A, so the rate
of destruction of B, k A times

214
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:30,160
B, instead of writing A here,
it's pretty much constant for

215
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,730
the whole time.

216
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:34,310
I'm just going to write A0.

217
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,650
So now, if k times A0 is a
constant, and this looks

218
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,160
awfully like a first
order reaction.

219
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,430
So I can solve for it.

220
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,800
And I get that, so I can just
write the answer because I've

221
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,590
done this already.

222
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:50,940
I don't have to do it again.

223
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:56,760
The concentration of B then goes
like B0 e to the minus k

224
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,080
prime t, that's the first
order reaction.

225
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,670
Where k prime here is this new
rate constant, this new

226
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:10,860
number, which is k, times A0.

227
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,260
So that's easy to solve also.

228
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,910
So always go to the limiting
cases, because

229
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,150
they tend to easy.

230
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:25,120
And if you were to go to the
full solution and put in this

231
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,220
limiting case, then you'd find
that you get the right answer

232
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,840
this way as well.

233
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,890
You can directly go to the easy
way of doing it, or you

234
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,170
can go through the whole process
of solving it and

235
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,140
putting the approximation
in there.

236
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,530
And do the cancellations
and get this.

237
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,710
But this is much easier.

238
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,590
Just writing the answer down
is always much easier.

239
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,540
So it's a pseudo first
order reaction.

240
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,320
We call this a pseudo first
order reaction.

241
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,460
So we're done with the
simple stuff now.

242
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:04,960
Any questions on first order
and second order reactions?

243
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,990
So the next step is, you've
got a reaction.

244
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,130
It could be a gas phase
reaction, it could be a

245
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,080
solution phase reaction.

246
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:17,000
There's some quantity, some
property, of the solution

247
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,760
that's going to change.

248
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,000
That's going to allow
you to follow it as

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,420
a function of time.

250
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,920
And that property could
be many things.

251
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,730
It could be spectroscopic.

252
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,770
It could be that there's an
absorption in the visible that

253
00:15:27,770 --> 00:15:30,980
changes as the concentration
of one of

254
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,760
your reactants changes.

255
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,210
Or one of the products could
have an absorption band that

256
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:38,600
you could follow in time.

257
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,640
Or you could using infrared
spectroscopy to

258
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,090
follow it in time.

259
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,360
Or if you have a reaction in
the gas phase, and you have

260
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,730
more products or less products
than the reactants, and the

261
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,224
pressure is going to change
in time if you

262
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:49,730
have a finite volume.

263
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,840
So there's usually some quantity
that you can use to

264
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:59,150
follow the reaction in time
to extract out data.

265
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:03,140
And then from that data, that
you want to know what are the

266
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,790
kinetics of this reaction.

267
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:05,790
Because eventually
you're going to

268
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,770
try to find a mechanism.

269
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,440
You're going to try to find a
mechanism that's consistent

270
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,520
with the data.

271
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,780
So you get data.

272
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,980
Then you want extract out of the
rate constants and orders.

273
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,790
So let's assume that you've
found a way to get data.

274
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:24,270
And now you've got to
analyze your data.

275
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:30,980
And suppose that you've found a
way to measure the reactant

276
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:33,150
concentration as a
function of time.

277
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,210
And let's say that in the first
case, the simplest case

278
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:43,100
is that you have one reactant.

279
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:50,140
So you have one reactant, A.
So A goes to products.

280
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,540
And you've managed to extract
A as a function of time.

281
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,670
Well, the obvious thing to do
is to plot A versus time and

282
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,670
see what it fits like.

283
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,520
So you take A versus time,
and you plot it.

284
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:07,620
And you know that if you plot
log A versus time and it's a

285
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,515
straight line, well,
that's going to be

286
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:12,730
a first order process.

287
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,320
Plot log A versus time in a
straight line, you know that's

288
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,290
going to be first order.

289
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:20,040
If it doesn't go to a straight
line you know

290
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,100
it's not first order.

291
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:26,810
So then you go ahead and plot
one over A versus time.

292
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:32,630
And if it's a straight line,
you know it's second order.

293
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,230
And if it's not second order,
it's not a straight line.

294
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,140
It's not a straight line, you
look for some other order.

295
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,590
So that's one way to do it.

296
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,060
And you've got to have enough
points on your graph, because

297
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:48,780
if I were to plot a, let's say
this is my data point, if I

298
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,700
have a second order process, at
the beginning it's going to

299
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,570
look an awful lot like a
first order process.

300
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,460
It's not until after
a while that it's

301
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,130
going to start to deviate.

302
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,460
So you've got to have enough
points down in time to make

303
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,810
sure that you can differentiate
between a

304
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:10,300
straight line and a line
that's not straight.

305
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:15,170
And usually, that's often
a mistake that

306
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,330
experimentalists make.

307
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:17,500
They look at the beginning.

308
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,050
They say, oh, it's a straight
line, work is done.

309
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:22,730
Go home.

310
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:30,930
But usually you need to have a
good amount of the reactant

311
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,180
consumed before you can tell the
difference between first

312
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,700
and second order.

313
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,000
So you'll have an opportunity
to do this on the homework.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,470
This kind of exercise of
extracting the order of a

315
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,340
simple reaction.

316
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,520
Another way to do it if you have
a simple reaction is to

317
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,340
look at half-lives.

318
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:00,230
That would be the half-life
method.

319
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,700
If you can measure A as a
function of time, then you

320
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,060
know when you've gotten
A over two.

321
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:13,500
So, you know that if I look at
the half-life versus the

322
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,870
concentration, the initial
concentration, of my reactant,

323
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,370
that tells me something
about the order.

324
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:22,720
Because we saw that for our
first order, t 1/2 was

325
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:30,530
independent of the initial
concentration.

326
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,640
And that for a second order, t
1/2 was proportional to one

327
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,620
over the inverse of the
initial concentration.

328
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,580
So if you plot t 1/2 versus A0,
or have a few A0 versus t

329
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,640
1/2s, then you can tell the
difference between first order

330
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,770
and a second order reaction,
and see which one fits.

331
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:59,710
Sometimes to get even more solid
numbers, because from

332
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:01,450
here you can also extract k.

333
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,670
If you have a bunch of points,
of t 1/2 versus A0, you can

334
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,470
extract k, the rate constant.

335
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,040
Not just the order,
but also the rate

336
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
constant out of this data.

337
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:14,650
You can use multiple lifetimes
if you have enough data.

338
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:15,910
Multiple lifetimes.

339
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:21,540
So you can define, you
can define a t 3/4.

340
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:26,470
Which is the amount of time it
takes for the concentration of

341
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,800
A to be 1/4 of what you
started out with.

342
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,400
So 3/4 is gone.

343
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,010
And then you can put that into
your first order rate law.

344
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:46,530
So when you have log of A over
A0 is equal to minus kt, you

345
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,765
get that t 3/4, we can solve
for t 3/4, and you get that

346
00:20:51,765 --> 00:20:57,670
that's equal to two
log two, over k.

347
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,970
And then you can do the
same thing for a

348
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:01,440
second order process.

349
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,390
So this is first order.

350
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:10,190
You plug in t 3/4 and A is equal
to 1/4 A0, and you solve

351
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:16,240
for t 3/4 for a second
order process.

352
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,880
And you get that this is equal
to three over A0 times k.

353
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,030
So it's the same functional
form as these two.

354
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,960
But there's a pre-factor
that's different here.

355
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,420
So here there's a two
that comes in there.

356
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,500
And here there's there's a three
that comes in there.

357
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,910
And so there's an obvious way to
tell, then, if you have the

358
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,630
t 1/2 and the t 3/4 signs.

359
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,640
Basically, you follow, instead
of having many reactions,

360
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,130
instead of having many
reactions to do, with

361
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,050
different A0's here you
can do one reaction.

362
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,450
If you do one reaction and you
watch the reactant go away,

363
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,670
and you time it.

364
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:57,430
When 1/2 of it is gone, that's
one time, then you keep going,

365
00:21:57,430 --> 00:22:00,060
like 3/4 is gone, that's
another time.

366
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,210
Then you can take the ratio
of those two times.

367
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:10,800
Of t 3/4 versus t 1/2.
t 3/4 versus t 1/2.

368
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:13,050
And if it's a first order
process, the ratio

369
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:19,090
here is just two.

370
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:24,840
And if you take t 3/4 over t
1/2 and it's a second order

371
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:32,990
process, the ratio is three.

372
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:38,010
So with one experiment, then,
you can extract out the order.

373
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,990
You can't extract out,
well, you can extract

374
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,630
out the rate constant.

375
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:44,150
If you know the order then you
know which equation fits, and

376
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,230
you can extract out the
the rate constant,

377
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:46,980
with a big error bar.

378
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,590
You're always better off doing
many multiple lifetimes of

379
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,540
different A0's or many of
these just to get more

380
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,470
statistics in the result.

381
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,780
So this is the simple process.

382
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,640
And you always try, if you have
something complicated,

383
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,920
you always try to bring it
back to a one component

384
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,580
process by doing something
like flooding.

385
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,470
So if you have five different
reactants, if you make four of

386
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,290
them in very large quantities
and keep one of them in very

387
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,170
small quantities, then all the
four that are in large

388
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:25,140
quantities are basically
constant over the process.

389
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,410
And you basically are
looking at only one

390
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,090
reactant going away.

391
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:34,270
And then you can use these
methods to figure out what the

392
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,070
order is for that
one reactant.

393
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:45,890
So, questions about simple one
reactant sort of processes.

394
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:48,250
It's pretty straightforward.

395
00:23:48,250 --> 00:24:02,480
So now, let's say we have more
complicated reactions.

396
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,210
There are two ways that
we can deal with that.

397
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,360
The first, I already mentioned,
which is the

398
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,850
flooding which we'll
get back to.

399
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,880
And another way is called,
so we have

400
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,110
some complicated reactions.

401
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,400
Complex reactions, with multiple
reactants, that's A

402
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,100
plus B plus C goes
to products.

403
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,600
And there could be some

404
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:28,270
stoichiometry in front of there.

405
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,970
So one of the ways to deal
with that is called the

406
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,160
initial rate method.

407
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,630
We want to find out orders
and rate constants.

408
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:46,630
Initial rate method.

409
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:53,270
So if I look at minus dA/dt,
one of the reactants or the

410
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,300
rate of the reaction near
time t equals zero.

411
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,310
That's the initial rate.

412
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,820
Right as the reaction starts.

413
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,450
I mix everything together and
I, just as after I mix it

414
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:06,640
together, I watch the process
of A disappearing or B

415
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,530
disappearing or C
disappearing.

416
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:13,260
And so in reality what I'm doing
is minus delta A / delta

417
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,090
t near t equals zero, where
delta t is a small interval.

418
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,910
So there's not much change in
delta A. Experimentally

419
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,460
that's what I do.

420
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,410
And that's pretty much,
essentially getting this

421
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,550
number out.

422
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,590
And we're going to call
that the initial rate.

423
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:32,990
And the initial rate is k, and
at the beginning I haven't

424
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:33,790
used up anything.

425
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:37,200
So all the initial
concentrations are there A0 to

426
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,280
the alpha, B0 to the beta,
C0 to the gamma.

427
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:46,480
Et cetera if you have
more reactants.

428
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,310
So you measure this.

429
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:55,320
You measure this R0, and then
you repeat the same process

430
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,880
with a new concentration of one
of those three reactants.

431
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,690
So with A0 prime, let's say.

432
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:09,260
And then you get a
new R0, R0 prime.

433
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:14,340
Then you take the ratios of
these R0 and R0 primes, R0

434
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,640
divided by R0 prime.

435
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,640
So R0 is k A0 to the alpha, B0
to the beta, C0 to the gamma,

436
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,990
then you have k A0 prime
to the alpha.

437
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,210
B0 to the beta, C0
to the gamma,

438
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:40,240
and the k's you disappear.

439
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,250
The B0's disappear.

440
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,150
The C0's disappear.

441
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,210
The only thing that we've
changed is the concentration

442
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,450
of A0 to begin with.

443
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:50,230
So the ratios of these initial
rates is the ratios of the

444
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:56,310
A0's to the alpha power, to
the order in terms of A0.

445
00:26:56,310 --> 00:27:00,330
So if you're clever about your
choice of ratios, then you can

446
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,690
get alpha pretty easily.

447
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:16,280
So if you choose, so if you
now choose A0 prime to be

448
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:27,770
equal to 1/2 A0, then you
measure R0 over R0 prime.

449
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:35,560
And if you get one, then you
know that that alpha's zero.

450
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,250
Alpha has to be zero here.

451
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,610
Then you know alpha is zero,
that gives you the order.

452
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,100
It's a zero order reaction.

453
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,740
If you get that R0 over R0 prime
is square root of two,

454
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:51,460
or rather 1/2, then a square
root of two, square root of 2,

455
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,950
then you know that
alpha is 1/2.

456
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,490
And that's a half order.

457
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,060
We haven't seen any half order
reactions yet, but we will.

458
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,320
Those are indicative of a
complicated mechanisms.

459
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,940
But that's what you would get
out of this experiment.

460
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:15,230
If you get that it's equal to
two, if you get that this

461
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,880
ratio is equal to two, then you
know that alpha is equal

462
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,500
to one, et cetera.

463
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,880
So it's a pretty easy way
to get the order.

464
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,410
Then you repeat the
experiment.

465
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,535
Now instead of changing A0,
you keep A0 constant

466
00:28:30,535 --> 00:28:31,600
and you change B0.

467
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,710
Or, you can use flooding or
isolation, which is the next

468
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,760
process to get the
other orders.

469
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,400
And eventually you get
the rate constant.

470
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,720
Once you have all the orders,
and you have R0, then you have

471
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,070
the rate constant.

472
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:52,540
OK, so that's one
way of doing it.

473
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,260
And a second way of
doing it is the

474
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,360
way we already mentioned.

475
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,500
To solve the second order
reaction in two components.

476
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:06,300
Which is to flood the
reaction with

477
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,110
everything except for one.

478
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:14,430
So this is called flooding
or isolation.

479
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:20,920
Basically, you isolate one
reactant and watch it.

480
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,460
You're trying to get
back to a system,

481
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,840
which is a simple system.

482
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,990
Which is a system
of one reaction.

483
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:31,090
So let's say you take A0 to be
much smaller than all the

484
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:31,910
other species.

485
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:35,150
You flood with B and C,
and you isolate A0.

486
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:41,510
And then your rate minus
dA/dt, it's going

487
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,250
to be A to the alpha.

488
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,840
And instead of B, well, during
that process B's going to say

489
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,030
pretty much constant.

490
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,110
Because it's hugely concentrated
in B. You can

491
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,930
replace B with B0.

492
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:54,810
You can replace C with C0.

493
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:58,720
So now you have an effective
constant, an effective rate

494
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:06,890
constant, and then you have a
process which is effectively,

495
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,820
or pseudo, one reactant.

496
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:14,380
Then you can use these methods
here, you can plot A versus

497
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,410
time, you can find path lines,
et cetera, to gather

498
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,440
the order for it.

499
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:28,240
Then you can get alpha
and k prime.

500
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,100
And if you can change
B0 and C0, then you

501
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:33,220
get k out of this.

502
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,340
So this is basically all fairly
straightforward, just

503
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:42,440
tedious experimentation to get
all these numbers out.

504
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,240
OK, any questions on this?

505
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,080
You'll get experience
on the homework.

506
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,470
There's likely to be a question
on the final where

507
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,680
you're given data and
asked to extract out

508
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:59,030
orders and rate constants.

509
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,730
So let's move on now.

510
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:07,260
So, so far we've looked at
first and second order

511
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:10,480
elementary processes, and we've
looked at taking data

512
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,390
and extracting out rate
and rate constant.

513
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:19,370
And the next step is to
build mechanisms.

514
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:31,300
So a mechanism is when you take
a complicated reaction,

515
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:37,820
like A plus B plus C goes to D
plus E. And you break it up

516
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,050
into elementary steps.

517
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,060
What's an elementary step?

518
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:43,400
An elementary step
is a step which

519
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,440
happens in a single reaction.

520
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,690
So I could hypothesize that
this complicated reaction

521
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,590
happens in three steps, where I
need to have a molecule of A

522
00:31:55,590 --> 00:32:00,220
and a molecule of B collide with
each other to first form

523
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,630
an intermediate F. Then I want
a molecule of F plus a

524
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,850
molecule of B to collide to
form intermediate G plus a

525
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:12,250
product D. Then have the
intermediate G plus reactant C

526
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,390
collide together to form the
product E. So this set of

527
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,020
elementary steps, where at each
step you have a collision

528
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,390
of two or three molecules
together, three is not so

529
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:29,520
common but two is very common,
those elementary steps are

530
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,660
called the steps of
the mechanisms.

531
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:44,440
And these elementary steps you
can define something called

532
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:53,130
molecularity, which is the
number of species that you

533
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:56,460
need to collide with each
other in one of these

534
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,510
elementary steps.

535
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:00,210
So the molecularity here would
be two, you need two

536
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,160
molecules to react.

537
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,240
Here it's two, here it's two.

538
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,200
If I have an elementary step
which is a zero order in one

539
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,490
reactant, then the molecularity
would be one.

540
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,690
Or I could have A plus A, the
same molecules have to collide

541
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:13,400
with each other.

542
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,330
Molecularity would be two.

543
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,800
And the molecularity and
the order of the

544
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,600
reaction are connected.

545
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,790
So if you have something which
is a molecularity of one, then

546
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,730
it's going to be a first
order reaction.

547
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:29,570
One reactant is just sitting by
itself, falls apart, like

548
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,350
in radioactive decay.

549
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,270
Molecularity of one, that's
a first order of process.

550
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:36,510
If I need to have two molecules
come together, then

551
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,790
it's a second order process.

552
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,900
If I have to have three
molecules collide at the same

553
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:44,520
time together, molecularity of
three, then it's going to

554
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,650
depend on the concentration of
all three at the same time.

555
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:52,600
That's called a ternary
reaction, and those are really

556
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,140
quite rare.

557
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,300
Termolecular reactions,
you need to have your

558
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,820
concentrations very, very high
to statistically get an event

559
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:07,370
happening where all three
molecules collide together.

560
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:12,750
So three body reaction is hard
and anything higher than three

561
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,050
body is essentially
impossible.

562
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,880
So that limits your choices,
which is nice.

563
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,940
So that's the mechanism.

564
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,700
And so what we're going to do
next is go through some

565
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,200
mechanisms.

566
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,730
Some simple mechanisms and
build up the complexity.

567
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:33,910
Any questions about
mechanisms here?

568
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:37,430
What we're doing here is, we're
formulating a framework.

569
00:34:37,430 --> 00:34:39,715
Where we can go back and look
at things that are more

570
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:42,530
complicated, like chain
reactions or explosions or

571
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:47,680
enzymatic reactions, and know
when to apply approximations

572
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,530
and et cetera.

573
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:52,750
So we basically, here,
are just laying

574
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:58,210
down the ground rules.

575
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:03,820
So let's go to our first example
of a mechanism, a more

576
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,320
complicated reaction.

577
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,050
And what we're going to do is
we're going to extract out

578
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,340
integrated rate laws out of
all these mechanisms.

579
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,710
And see what it looks like,
as a function of time.

580
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,610
So the first one we're
going to do is

581
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:22,340
called parallel reactions.

582
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,280
Simple mechanism.

583
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:31,030
In this case here I have one
reactant, and that reactant

584
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,040
has a choice.

585
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,030
You can think of it as a
radioactive decay, an atom

586
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:41,050
decaying in two different
channels.

587
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:44,670
So it can decay into B, or it
can decay into C. There are

588
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:50,470
two rate constants, k1 and k2.

589
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:54,360
So you can write it like this,
or you can write it as A goes

590
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,740
to B plus C. This is how you
would write a reaction.

591
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,290
And this is how you would
write your mechanism.

592
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:10,090
A goes to B and A goes to C.
Each elementary step, these

593
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,550
are the elementary steps and
this is the complex reaction,

594
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,440
each elementary step
is unimolecular.

595
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
It's a first order process.

596
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,890
So in all of these examples, the
first thing you do is you

597
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:24,330
write your rate law.

598
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,190
The rate at which A gets
created or destroyed.

599
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,240
And there are two paths.

600
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,310
It gets destroyed and into
B, with a rate which is

601
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:37,540
proportional to the
concentration of A, and it

602
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:43,040
gets destroyed into C,
proportional to the

603
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,670
concentration of A. So you write
down all the ways that A

604
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:51,100
can get destroyed.

605
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,160
There are two ways here.

606
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,660
Two channels.

607
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:59,270
This one happens to be fairly
easy to solve. k1 plus k2

608
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,970
times A, and you've
seen this before.

609
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,590
It's minus dA/dt as a constant
times A. That's

610
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,720
a first order process.

611
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,530
So you can just write
down the answer.

612
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,420
You don't need to do
any math here.

613
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,680
You recognize that we just
call this one k prime.

614
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,010
And that the rate is A as
a function of time.

615
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:22,185
This is A0 e to the minus
k1 plus k2 times t.

616
00:37:22,185 --> 00:37:24,520
And everything you've learned
about plotting first order

617
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,370
processes et cetera, is
applicable here, where the

618
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,920
rate constant is the
sum of these two.

619
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,580
So that's for the reactant.

620
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,730
The products are also
interesting to plot as a

621
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:40,260
function of time, to see how
they are related to each other

622
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,650
in terms of their
concentrations.

623
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:52,400
So let me go through
this also.

624
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,420
When things get more complicated
we'll quickly go

625
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,110
and make approximations.

626
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:59,380
But for now, we can still
do everything exactly.

627
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:04,960
So you write down your rate law
for the product. dB/dt is

628
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:14,270
equal to k1 A. dC/dt is equal
to k2 times A. The formation

629
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,420
of B depends linearly on A.
The formation of C depends

630
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,050
linearly on A, because they're
both first order processes.

631
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:25,800
To make B and C. And
you integrate.

632
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,180
You integrate here from
zero to B, dB.

633
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:38,430
Is equal from zero
to t, A dt, k1.

634
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:39,650
A is a function of time.

635
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,570
And we've already
solved for that.

636
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,700
It's this exponential
up there.

637
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:51,370
So you plug in here A of time.

638
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,430
And you turn the crank and you
integrate, and it's an

639
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:53,990
exponential.

640
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,020
So it's not so hard
to integrate.

641
00:38:56,020 --> 00:39:00,280
And you get that B is a function
of time is k1 times

642
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:10,480
A0 over k1 plus k2 times one
minus e to the minus k1 plus

643
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,680
k2 times the time.

644
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,730
Things are already starting
to get a little bit more

645
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,190
messy in the math.

646
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,700
And then to get C, you actually

647
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,470
don't need to do anything.

648
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:23,280
Because you notice that the only
difference between B and

649
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,670
C here is replacing
k2 with k1.

650
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,360
So don't worry about
doing any math.

651
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:34,100
Just write down the answer. k2
A0, you interchange k1 and k2

652
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:36,890
at every step.

653
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:42,000
One minus e to the minus k1
plus k2 times the time.

654
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,480
The only difference is up
here in the k2 term.

655
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,090
And those are your equations
for k1 and k2.

656
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:53,610
And what you find, is the ratio
of B to C is a constant.

657
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,980
If I divide B by C, everything
cancels out except for the k1

658
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,690
and the k2 here.

659
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:02,960
Is equal to k1 over k2.

660
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:11,280
And that is called the
branching ratio.

661
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,390
The branching ratio, because
there are two branches out of

662
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,210
the reactions.

663
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:18,900
And this gives you the ratio of
which one is more likely to

664
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,030
happen than the other one.

665
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,510
And so if k1 is much
bigger than k2, the

666
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,400
rate is per unit time.

667
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,420
The units of k1 are per second
or per minute or per hour.

668
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,730
So if this is big, if k1 is big,
then mostly you're going

669
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:38,830
from A to B, and only a little
bit of C is formed.

670
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,830
And the ratio of B and
C is always constant.

671
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:47,500
And so you can plot, then,
you can plot the result.

672
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:57,900
You can sketch out the result.

673
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,520
So you know that A is going to
come down exponentially.

674
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,250
Time on this axis here,
concentrations

675
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,010
on this axis here.

676
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:13,080
So this is A as a function
of time.

677
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,510
That's that equation up here,
in exponential decay.

678
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,490
And the quantity of A. And B and
C are going to come up in

679
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:27,120
time, also, with this
exponential format here.

680
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:30,370
B is going to saturate at this
ratio right here, k1 A0

681
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,650
divided by k1 plus k2.

682
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,560
C is going to saturate at
this quantity here.

683
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:38,070
So they're going to start
both at zero.

684
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:52,410
And B is eventually going to go
to k1 A0 over k1, plus k2.

685
00:41:52,410 --> 00:42:08,550
And C, eventually, will go
to k2 A0 over k1 plus k2.

686
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:14,140
And this, and the ratio of these
two lines at every point

687
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:22,760
is k1 over k2.

688
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,960
So, a simple question, for
instance, that you might be of

689
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:32,520
the type that you might be asked
to look at is, suppose

690
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,220
that k1 is 1/10 of k2.

691
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,630
Which would you expect?

692
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:48,340
Would you expect to
have, let's see.

693
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,610
So C is in green here.

694
00:42:51,610 --> 00:43:05,810
C, B. Or do you expect,
so A comes down.

695
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:10,030
B comes up.

696
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:17,280
C comes up like this, or do you
expect the last choice,

697
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:39,380
I'm going to put the last choice
here, so this is, let's

698
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,710
call this choice number one.

699
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:44,450
Choice number two.

700
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:49,240
Choice number three.

701
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,670
So k1, the rate k1 is
1/10 of the rate k2.

702
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,560
That tells you something about
the branching ratio.

703
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:00,960
So do you expect this one here
to be the right one?

704
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,880
How many people think this
is the right one?

705
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:06,870
What about this one here?

706
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:09,350
How many people think this
is the right one?

707
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:11,130
One person.

708
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,500
What about this one here?

709
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,760
So the branching ratio is
the ratio of the two.

710
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,750
It's 1/10.

711
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:20,670
So this is approximately, in
my sketch, poor sketch,

712
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:22,350
granted, but this is
approximately 10

713
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:24,840
times bigger than this.

714
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,550
So that's the ratio
that you'd expect.

715
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,490
And it's the right, here k1 is
the rate into B. It's slower

716
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:38,420
than the rate into C. So,
you got it right.

717
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,120
So for more complicated, we
have a more complicated

718
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,740
process, we're going to ask you
the same sort of stuff.

719
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:48,070
And it won't be as
straightforward.

720
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,140
Any questions on this
beginning here?

721
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:59,370
Next time we're going to finish
with the parallel first

722
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,120
and second order processes.

723
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,280
And hopefully we'll get done
with the complex reactions and

724
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,740
mechanisms and move
on to, I forgot

725
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,740
what's next on the list.

726
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:17,150
But some explosions or
chain reactions.
