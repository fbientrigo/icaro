8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,290
PROFESSOR: So last time, there
was a question that was asked

9
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,610
about the order of
magnitude rates.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,390
You asked the question
about the

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,630
concentration of the catalysts.

12
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,452
So the rates that I gave you,
which were the rates of

13
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:36,050
reactions are basically
order of magnitude.

14
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,380
They're estimates and odd
numbers that, they obviously

15
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,800
depend, as you pointed out,
depend on the concentration of

16
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,400
the catalyst.

17
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:46,370
Depends on the concentration
of the reactants.

18
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,500
Depends on where you are on
those concentrations.

19
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,660
As we saw when we did enzyme
catalysis, is that depending

20
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,000
on KM, the Michaelis constant,
and the substrate

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,350
concentration, if your
substrate's concentration is

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:08,400
much higher than KM, you are in
the maximum velocity limit,

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,730
where the rate depends on
k2 times the initial

24
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,370
concentration of enzyme.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,640
In that case the rate of the
reaction depends just on the

26
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,800
concentration of enzyme,
and not on the

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,870
concentration of substrate.

28
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:27,410
But if you are at the small
concentration of substrate

29
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:31,630
relative to KM, then your rate
depends linearly with the

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,190
concentration of substrate.

31
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:38,780
And the same thing happens
with the non-enzymatic

32
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:43,470
catalyst, that there will be
some sort of mechanism that

33
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,820
goes along with it.

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,660
And most likely it's
going to be second

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:47,650
order in the catalyst.

36
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:54,630
And the reactant if it's just
the two body process.

37
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,580
But it could be more
complicated.

38
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,660
So definitely those

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,430
concentrations will go in there.

40
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,430
But a priori, it's not clear
how they will go in there.

41
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:06,870
But the orders of magnitude
are roughly right.

42
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,450
And the basic idea is that you
change your rate of reactions

43
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,950
by 15, 18 orders of magnitude
with the right catalyst,

44
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,810
especially if it's a biological
catalyst.

45
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:22,280
One concept that I didn't go
through last time, which is

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:34,360
also quite useful, it's called
the turnover number.

47
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,630
Turnover number.

48
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,920
And this is useful for
any kind of catalyst.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,910
But for enzymatic, or enzyme
catalysts, the

50
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,380
turnover number is k cat.

51
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,900
The number per second.

52
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,300
It's a rate per second.

53
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:01,760
How many times does a reactant
get, the number of times that

54
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,730
a reactant turns into a product

55
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,300
per second, per catalyst.

56
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,760
So let me write it out.

57
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:34,330
So it's the number of product
formed per second, per second,

58
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:45,030
per enzyme, per molecule
of enzyme.

59
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,470
OK, so if one enzyme is going to
be there, there's going to

60
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:50,180
be some substrate going in.

61
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,800
Coming in, the pocket
coming out.

62
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,990
Coming in, the pocket coming
out, so the number of cycles

63
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,250
of this process per second.
is the turnover number.

64
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,450
And so if you are where the
concentration of substrate is

65
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:06,190
very much larger than the
Michaelis constant, where are

66
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:10,000
you are at the saturation limit,
then this turnover

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,710
number doesn't depend on the
substrate concentration.

68
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:16,900
It's just k cat.

69
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,860
So that's why k cat
is important.

70
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:33,850
As this turnover number in the
maximum velocity limit.

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,080
Because in the maximum velocity
limit, then the

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,080
process that's dominant is the
second process, ES goes to

73
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,190
enzyme plus product.

74
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:47,170
The first process here is not
the rate limiting step.

75
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,170
This is the rate
limiting step.

76
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,840
Because the substrate
concentration is very high.

77
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,920
So this first part goes very
high, goes very fast.

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:59,550
And the number of product
formed per second, per

79
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,680
molecule of enzyme, the number
of molecules formed for

80
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:11,150
second, that's the rate
of product formation.

81
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:14,790
Rate of product formation
per second.

82
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:20,330
Divided by the concentration
of the enzyme.

83
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,700
If you normalize by the
number of enzyme.

84
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,240
So this becomes rate of product
formation in moles per

85
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,870
second, divided by
moles of enzyme.

86
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,410
It's the same thing as what
we're saying here in words.

87
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,090
And so the rate of product
formation is dP/dt, and you

88
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,260
divide that by the concentration
of enzyme, which

89
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,380
you can write as E0. dp/dt,
and the maximum

90
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:47,230
rate limit is k max.

91
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,840
It's a constant divided by E0.

92
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,130
And k max is k cat times
E0 divided by E0.

93
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,340
The E0's come out.

94
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,320
And this is k cat.

95
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:08,200
Which is basically k2.

96
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,960
So that's the turnover number.

97
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,290
Any questions on this
turnover number?

98
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,370
You see that a lot in catalyst
literature and

99
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,850
especially the enzymes.

100
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:27,310
I have to get out these
lecture notes.

101
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,010
Send these back.

102
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:35,650
OK, so the last topic
I want to talk about

103
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,240
is oscillating reactions.

104
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:49,040
It's sort of like an
interesting topic.

105
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,940
And it's applicable not just
to just chemistry, but it's

106
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,450
basically playing with the
differential equations.

107
00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:01,700
And you'll see this sort of
stuff later if you keep doing

108
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,100
science that involves coupled
differential equations.

109
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:09,330
It's just all over the place.

110
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,230
So normally we have an
equilibrium process.

111
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:18,760
A goes to B, B goes back to A.
And if you start out with

112
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,130
something which is out of
equilibrium, then you will

113
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,700
eventually reach equilibrium at
a rate which is dependent

114
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,530
on those two rates. k1
plus k minus one.

115
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,730
So B will to come up to
some B equilibrium.

116
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,910
And A will, if you start out
with a lot of A, and a little

117
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,760
bit of B, and concentration of
A, will come down smoothly,

118
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,280
monotonically, to the
equilibrium state.

119
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,790
But sometimes, if you're out
of equilibrium, and this

120
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:54,720
doesn't have to be chemistry.

121
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,550
It could be anything that's
out of equilibrium, your

122
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,300
emotion's out of equilibrium.

123
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,090
Stock market is out
of equilibrium.

124
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,840
Population dynamics are
out of equilibrium.

125
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,750
The weather.

126
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:14,630
Whatever.

127
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,350
So, you're out of equilibrium,
let's say this is equilibrium

128
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:24,590
for A, this is equilibrium for
B, let me try to keep them

129
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,140
somewhat the same as
here, I messed up.

130
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:31,980
You're out of equilibrium, you
start down here for A. And

131
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:36,240
you, instead of going linearly
down or monotonically down,

132
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,380
exponentially down to the

133
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,590
equilibrium, instead you overshoot.

134
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,190
And you keep going
back and forth.

135
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,870
Like a spring.

136
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,990
And then B does the
same thing.

137
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,380
Overshoots, comes down.

138
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:50,760
Overshoots, comes down.

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,450
Like a pendulum.

140
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,820
A lot of things work
like that.

141
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,490
The heart is something that
works like that, right?

142
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:00,790
It beats.

143
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,160
It's not in equilibrium.

144
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,050
Good thing it's not
in equilibrium.

145
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,640
So the heart is one example of
something that oscillates,

146
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,010
back and forth, back
and forth.

147
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,100
And so there are actually many
examples of complicated

148
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,690
processes that involve
chemistry, that aren't at

149
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:26,970
equilibrium, that instead go
back and forth, in and out, of

150
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,080
on one side or the other
of equilibrium.

151
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,460
Now, there's an important
feature of, if you want to

152
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:42,310
build a chemical process
that looks like this.

153
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,170
It's often very useful to have
a particular step in the

154
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:56,030
mechanism that's called
an autocatalysis step.

155
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,490
And that provides feedback.

156
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,950
It's like, if my microphone
here, the speaker which is

157
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:11,450
here, I were to stand right in
front of the speaker and my

158
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:15,190
microphone would pick up the
volume from the speaker, it

159
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,450
would get amplified,
and I get feedback.

160
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,040
And that would be a bad thing.

161
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,940
So this is a form of
feedback here.

162
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,320
You need some sort of feedback
that the reaction knows that

163
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,930
you're building up, that
this is going too fast.

164
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,220
And then there's a feedback
process that

165
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,080
brings it back up.

166
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,070
And a feedback process that
goes back and forth.

167
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,130
And the way you get this
feedback is by having a step

168
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:53,780
in the mechanism that has both
a molecule as part of the

169
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,620
reactants and as part
of the product.

170
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,360
It's not the same as a chain
reaction, where we talked

171
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,490
about an intermediate being
recycled and building up.

172
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:10,140
This is an actual reactant and
an actual product that's part

173
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,550
of this step here.

174
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,190
So this is an autocatalytic
step.

175
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,530
And let's just see what
that step looks like.

176
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,400
Suppose we just have
that step.

177
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,800
So we want to find out, as a
function of time, if you start

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,180
out with some A and B, what
happens to the concentration

179
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,660
of B as a function of time.

180
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,530
The time dependence of that.

181
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,920
Clearly it's going
to build up.

182
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,590
But how is it going
to build up?

183
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:46,000
So we need to solve for B
as a function of time.

184
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,270
So let's go ahead and write
down our rates.

185
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,300
The rate of the reaction is
d[A]/dt, is, let's put a rate

186
00:11:53,300 --> 00:12:00,400
constant here. k, k times
[A] times [B].

187
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,050
Now, [B] and [A]

188
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,190
are related to each other
through stoichiometry.

189
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:11,300
The concentration of B is the
concentration of B that he

190
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,650
started out with, [B]0, then
every time you destroy an A,

191
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,800
you create 2B.

192
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,710
So it's plus two times the
amount of A that you've

193
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:31,830
destroyed, [A]0 minus
[A], [A]0 is what

194
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:32,720
you started out with.

195
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,670
This is what's left over.

196
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,790
So the difference is what
you've destroyed.

197
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,410
But every time you destroy
an A to form 2B, you

198
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:43,170
also destroy a b.

199
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:46,470
So you have to subtract away the
B that you've destroyed.

200
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,450
Which is [A]0 minus [A].

201
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:56,540
This is the 2B that you created
by destroying A, and

202
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,640
this is the B that you destroy
by having to destroy A, for

203
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,410
the reaction.

204
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:05,770
You've got to bean-count
correctly.

205
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,030
Keep track of everything.

206
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:11,270
So [B], then, is just, I'm going
to drop those brackets.

207
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:17,860
B0 plus A0 minus A. So you
can plug that in here.

208
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:28,890
And is equal to k times A, times
B0 plus B0 minus A. And

209
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:34,720
now you have a differential
equation that only

210
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,510
contains A and time.

211
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:39,070
B0 is a constant.

212
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,080
And the way you solve that
is by partial fractions.

213
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,050
Use partial fractions,
solve for this.

214
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,245
And I'm not going to
go through the math

215
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:52,140
of solving for it.

216
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:59,440
It's not that interesting.

217
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,520
Let me give you the answer.

218
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,080
You end up with [B] as a
function of time, is this

219
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:16,040
function A0 plus B0 over one
plus A0 over B0 times e to the

220
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:24,440
minus k times A0 plus
B0 plus time.

221
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,010
And that's where the time
component comes in.

222
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,640
Whoops, I'm sorry.

223
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,950
Usually I don't have this
on, let's turn this off.

224
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:41,660
That's where the time
dependence comes in.

225
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,460
And clearly, at t is equal to
infinity, t equals infinity

226
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,300
just goes to zero.

227
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,570
So you have B as A0, plus B0,
everything goes through to the

228
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:54,050
product. t equals to zero,
this is equal to one.

229
00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,590
And B is equal to just B0.

230
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,490
Alright, and so the curve looks
something like this.

231
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,180
This is what it turns
out to look like.

232
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,920
We're starting with B0 here.

233
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,630
There's an induction period
where very little happens.

234
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:17,560
It's like the dormant stage.

235
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,340
So, locusts that are sitting
in the ground for seventeen

236
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:27,230
years waiting for something
to happen.

237
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,700
Dormant stage, the
induction period.

238
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,710
And suddenly something
starts to happen.

239
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,710
There's an inflection point.

240
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:39,020
And you get to A0 plus B0.

241
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,070
The locusts wake up.

242
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:47,970
And go to maximum
concentration.

243
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:55,250
So there's an s-like shape that
has an inflection point

244
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:04,290
and an induction period.

245
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:10,310
That's pretty typical of an
auto-catalytic reaction.

246
00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:13,270
OK so let's apply it
to a process now.

247
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,340
And again, this is going
to be coupled

248
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,320
differential equations.

249
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,890
Broadly, broadly applicable,
the example that I'm

250
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,560
going to give you.

251
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:45,030
This mechanism has been used
for all sorts of things.

252
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,820
So what do we have here?

253
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:51,560
We're going to have an island.

254
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,310
In the ocean.

255
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,780
Island here.

256
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:03,920
And it's going to be sunny,
so let's get some

257
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,810
yellow chalk here.

258
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,160
There's the sun.

259
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,860
And every now and then
it's going to rain.

260
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:15,160
We need some white chalk
for the rain.

261
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,000
There's a cloud that comes in.

262
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,600
That's going to be one
of the reactants.

263
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,820
And then some seeds blow in from
the continent, and grass

264
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:35,990
starts to grow on the island.

265
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,410
Grass.

266
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,590
And then there's a shipwreck and
a couple of rabbits get on

267
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,190
the island.

268
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:55,040
And now we have rabbits.

269
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,430
Rabbits.

270
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,490
A little tail on the back.

271
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,570
I hate rabbits.

272
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,280
I have a little vegetable
garden, a little tiny

273
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,180
vegetable garden.

274
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,990
And there are rabbits.

275
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:10,710
And I have to fence in my
vegetable garden and make it

276
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,405
impermeable impenetrable
to rabbits.

277
00:18:13,405 --> 00:18:15,990
And rabbits are very clever.

278
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,740
And my vegetable garden
looks like a fortress.

279
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:21,910
It's got a green fence.

280
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,380
Heavy duty things.

281
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,010
It's terrible.

282
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,070
Rabbits are awful.

283
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,590
They're very cute but
they're awful.

284
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,400
Alright, so now what happens.

285
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,060
Well, given the rain and the
grass, it turns out that this

286
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,140
island can only support
25 rabbits.

287
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:39,200
If there are more rabbits
than that, then

288
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,540
they all eat too much.

289
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,550
If there are less rabbits
then that's fine.

290
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:45,820
But 25 is about the
maximum that can

291
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,650
support on this island.

292
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:51,020
The rabbits, unfortunately,
are not that smart.

293
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,850
They don't know that.

294
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:56,380
They don't know that only 25
rabbits can live there.

295
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:04,750
So, what happens is that the
Year one, Year one there are

296
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,490
ten rabbits.

297
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:11,520
And the food condition
is great.

298
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,100
Lots of food, number
of rabbits.

299
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,060
Lots of food.

300
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,810
So the bunnies, the rabbits
make bunnies.

301
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:23,950
Lots of rabbits.

302
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:26,630
Year two, they kind
of went overboard.

303
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,240
Now there are 50 rabbits.

304
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,950
The food is lousy.

305
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,120
Terrible.

306
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,700
Well, there's a feedback here.

307
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,130
Feedback and rabbits
start to die off.

308
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,440
Don't reproduce as much.

309
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,520
Year three, we're back to ten.

310
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,040
Great food.

311
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,290
Rabbits don't notice.

312
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,250
They multiply.

313
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,040
Food is terrible.

314
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,390
And they just don't learn.

315
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,750
Humans are a little
bit like that.

316
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,990
Except our cycle isn't one
year, it's usually on the

317
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,870
order of 30 years.

318
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:03,870
It's like the memory of a
generation disappearing.

319
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,660
And we have to relearn the
mistakes of the previous

320
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,520
generation.

321
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,440
Science is like that too.

322
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,090
Science goes in cycles.

323
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:13,800
20, 30-year cycles.

324
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,310
Topics that were out of fashion
20 years ago, 25 years

325
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:19,270
ago, come back.

326
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:21,070
And suddenly everybody's
excited about them.

327
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:24,690
And all the ideas, of course
we make progress.

328
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,710
We go a little bit further
than we did 20 years ago.

329
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:28,630
But all the ideas that were
out of fashion 20

330
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,780
years ago come back.

331
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,380
People get really excited, and
they relearn all the mistakes

332
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,250
that people made at
the beginning.

333
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:37,770
Technology has improved, we know
more, and therefore we go

334
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,370
a little bit further this
cycle than we did

335
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:40,060
the previous cycle.

336
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,786
But it's really interesting to
look at history of science and

337
00:20:42,786 --> 00:20:52,140
see this sort of cycle.

338
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,240
So let's write a mechanism.

339
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,540
Let's write a mechanism here.

340
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:07,910
So we have rain plus grass
makes more grass.

341
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:09,240
At the rate k1.

342
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,860
That's autocatalytic.

343
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,430
It provides some feedback.

344
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:21,520
Then we have grass plus rabbits
make more rabbits.

345
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,870
OK, let's do more because
I don't know

346
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:28,820
how much, more, more.

347
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,900
Also autocatalytic.

348
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,200
Then we have rabbits.

349
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:39,700
Eventually, unfortunately,
rabbits become dead rabbits.

350
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:45,330
Rate k2 k3, and that's the
termination of the process.

351
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:47,580
OK, so now let's put some
chemistry on this.

352
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,220
Let's assume that instead of
having objects, live objects

353
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,440
here, we have chemical
molecules.

354
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,950
So A plus B goes to 2B.

355
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,820
That's the first step.

356
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:05,350
Then we have B plus C,
C is the rabbits.

357
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,960
And then C goes to some
sort of products.

358
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,450
Soil.

359
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,020
This is a very famous
mechanism.

360
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:26,820
It's called the Lotka-Volterra
mechanism.

361
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,970
It's also called the
predator-prey mechanism.

362
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,920
In my case here, I made it
sort of warm and fuzzy.

363
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,480
I didn't have a predator
in there.

364
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,720
But you could change this.

365
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,510
Instead of having rabbits
and grass, we could

366
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:47,170
have rabbits and foxes.

367
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:54,580
Where A is the grass, if you
take A to be the grass.

368
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:57,880
B to be the rabbits.

369
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:01,630
And C you be the foxes.

370
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,660
Works the same.

371
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,580
You have grass plus rabbits
makes more rabbits.

372
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,870
Rabbit plus foxes
make more foxes.

373
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:10,450
Eventually the foxes die off.

374
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:12,720
Same idea.

375
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:32,770
So now, let's solve this.

376
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:38,820
Let's assume that A, the rain
here, it's constant.

377
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,090
There's a steady
supply of rain.

378
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,860
It doesn't go away.

379
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,680
That makes sense in
my example here.

380
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:50,780
So the concentration of
A is kept constant.

381
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,590
In order to get oscillations to
keep going, that turns out

382
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:54,230
to be important.

383
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:58,410
To have one of the reactants
just keeping being

384
00:23:58,410 --> 00:23:59,500
reintroduced in the system.

385
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,040
Because it gets used up.

386
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,280
And when all the reactant gets
used up, then you're done.

387
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:10,060
So in the case of the heart,
we have to keep feeding

388
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,040
ourselves to produce energy.

389
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:18,850
Otherwise the heart
would stop.

390
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:22,350
OK, now we want to know what is
the concentration of B and

391
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,350
C as a function of time.

392
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:36,110
So we write down our kinetic
equations. dB/dt gets produced

393
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:39,800
through the first step, k1 A
times B, gets destroyed in the

394
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:47,850
second step. k2 B times C.
dC/dt, C gets produced in the

395
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,920
second step, k2 B times C. Gets
destroyed in the third

396
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,700
step. k3 times C, got to do your
bean-counting correctly.

397
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,870
And the strategy here that we're
going to use to solve

398
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:03,700
the problem is to assume that
we're at steady state.

399
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:06,200
We're going to find the solution
at steady state.

400
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,270
Then we're going to perturb
away from steady state a

401
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,800
little bit.

402
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:13,560
And see whether this creates
an oscillation.

403
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,230
First we need to find out what
the steady state solution is.

404
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,950
So first, let's find
steady state.

405
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:30,740
Then perturb away from
steady state.

406
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,470
We're looking at a harmonic
response, if

407
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,840
you've heard that term.

408
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,640
When it's going to look like
a spring, close to its

409
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,300
equilibrium state.

410
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,290
That means that we're going to
set it these two things equal

411
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:47,630
to zero, for this
steady state.

412
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,970
Things are not changing.

413
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,520
Concentration of B and
C are not changing.

414
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:53,970
A is not changing
on purpose here.

415
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:56,380
And so all these guys here
are then steady state

416
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,920
concentrations.

417
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,450
If we set it equal to zero.

418
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:10,110
We solve for A in this.

419
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,930
For C in this process here.

420
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,140
The B's cancel out here.

421
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:20,160
We divide by B. And you solve
for C as a function of A. So

422
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:27,600
this one here gives you C steady
state is equal to k1

423
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,750
over k2 times the concentration
of A. And this

424
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,210
one here, now you put in the C
and you solve for B, B steady

425
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:58,740
state, is equal to k3 over k2.

426
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:02,740
So the next step is to perturb
away from equilibrium.

427
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,820
Or from the steady
state, rather.

428
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,910
This is not equilibrium, it's
not equilibrium because we

429
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:18,060
keep adding A. We have to put
some input into the system.

430
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,890
So here we are.

431
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:23,980
We've got some concentration of
B here at the steady state.

432
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,910
We have some concentration
of C at the steady state.

433
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:35,480
And now we're going to add some
delta B to the system, or

434
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,760
delta C. Or both.

435
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,240
Delta C, we're going to ask the
question, given our system

436
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,630
here, how is it going
to respond?

437
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:51,280
It has a number of choices.

438
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:58,300
It could respond by going back
to the steady state in a

439
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:03,250
monotonic fashion.

440
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:07,420
Without overshooting.

441
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:15,910
This is kind of like an
overdamped system.

442
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:18,280
It's like having a shock
absorber on your car.

443
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,100
You go over a bump, the car
doesn't oscillate up and down.

444
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,170
It's sort of damped.

445
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,110
It's a damped oscillator.

446
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:27,010
It goes back to the
steady state.

447
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:40,320
Or, you could, there we go,
there's B, C. Or you could

448
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,980
perturb, and it could just
stay where it is.

449
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,490
That could happen too.

450
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:54,020
That's an inelastic response.

451
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:58,320
Kind of like the supply
and demand with oil.

452
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,790
The price of oil goes from $10
a barrel to $120 a barrel.

453
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,100
The use of oil doesn't seem to
be affected very much by the

454
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,585
increasing price.

455
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:08,870
You're still using
just as much oil.

456
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:16,280
There's an inelastic response.

457
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:20,690
What we're looking for is
something that has an elastic

458
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,940
response, or a harmonic
response.

459
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:34,010
We perturb it, it tries to
get back to steady state.

460
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,920
But because of feedback, and not
being over-damped, if it's

461
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,180
an oscillator, it goes
up and down.

462
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:51,540
Like a scale that is not well,
well, like a car that has bad

463
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,750
shock absorbers, all it
has is the springs.

464
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,720
Up and down.

465
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:03,730
So what we want is, we want
to solve for dB/dt as

466
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:22,320
a function of time.

467
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,580
We want, well, I'm going to
do everything in green.

468
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,040
Since I lost my white chalk.

469
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,780
We want delta B, delta C
as a function of time.

470
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,120
So, that means that we start
with B is B steady state plus

471
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:45,280
delta B, C is C steady state
plus delta C. And we put that

472
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,340
in our equations.

473
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:48,640
For dB/dt and dC/dt.

474
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:57,190
So now dB/dt is the same thing
as dB steady state plus delta

475
00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:01,730
B dt, which is d delta B / dt.

476
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,930
Because this is a
constant here.

477
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:11,670
And that's equal to k1 times A,
times B steady state plus

478
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:19,110
delta B. Minus k2 times B steady
state plus delta B

479
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,940
times C steady state plus delta
C. And then you have the

480
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,090
same thing for dC/dt, it's
going to look exactly

481
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:34,330
identical. d delta C / dt.

482
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:49,440
Thank you much, this is magic.
k2 times B steady state plus

483
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,340
delta B, times C steady state
plus delta C, minus k3 times C

484
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,830
steady state plus delta C.

485
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,770
So these are two differential
equations.

486
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:04,260
And there are coupled
differential equations.

487
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,300
Because delta B is occurring
here, here, and here.

488
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:12,990
So the time derivative of delta
C depends on delta B.

489
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:17,530
And the time derivative of delta
B depends on delta C.

490
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,180
It's a coupled system.

491
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:26,140
And if you actually expand this
out and take away all the

492
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:34,350
terms that cancel out, you end
up with something that looks

493
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:40,160
much simpler but is just as
hard. d delta B / dt is equal

494
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:52,900
to minus k3 delta C and d delta
C / dt is equal to k1 A

495
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:53,320
delta B.

496
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,820
And then you really see that
it's coupled, because the time

497
00:32:56,820 --> 00:33:00,190
derivative of delta B depends
on delta C. And the time

498
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,680
derivative of delta C depends
on delta B. And there's the

499
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:08,430
feedback sitting right here.

500
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:09,380
And that's what you do.

501
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,830
You learn how to
solve in 18.03.

502
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,460
So I'm not going to solve it
here, I'm just going to give

503
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,190
you the solutions.

504
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:16,050
Because that's what we're
interested in.

505
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,300
After all, you're not expected
to learn how

506
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,740
to solve this equation.

507
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,250
Although you should be able to
put the solutions in and make

508
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:33,350
sure that they do work out.

509
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:37,190
And so the solutions are
harmonic solutions.

510
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:41,180
Delta B is a function of time
is equal to delta B0.

511
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,990
The amount of the perturbation
times the cosine of omega t,

512
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,450
where omega is the frequency
of the oscillation.

513
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:59,370
Minus some pre-factor here, k3
over k1 A to the 1/2 power.

514
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:05,350
Times delta C0 sine
of omega t.

515
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,810
And then delta C
looks the same.

516
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,630
The same frequency.

517
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:15,770
Delta C0, cosine of omega t.

518
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:23,960
Plus k1 over A times k3
to the 1/2 power.

519
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:29,820
Delta B0 sine of omega t, where
omega, the frequency of

520
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,630
the oscillation, is these
rates. k1, k3 and A. So

521
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:37,360
obviously, keeping the
concentration of a constant is

522
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:40,210
important because we don't want
a time dependence here.

523
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,680
The rain is constant.

524
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,440
And then if you do that, then
you have this oscillation.

525
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,570
Up and down and up and down
with this frequency here.

526
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,770
You get exactly what we're
trying to get.

527
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:58,620
Which is this process
right here.

528
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:00,490
So let me give you an
example of this.

529
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:08,040
And the best way to do is to
actually go and see a movie of

530
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:20,730
a reaction that looks
like this.

531
00:35:20,730 --> 00:35:27,540
This is the reaction that was
optimized and created for

532
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,220
demonstration purposes.

533
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:35,240
So it's a pretty complicated
reaction.

534
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:40,910
There are ten steps
to the mechanism.

535
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:47,270
And if we gave you that
mechanism to solve for the

536
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,200
final exam, you would still
be here probably

537
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,360
two weeks form now.

538
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,740
It's pretty complicated.

539
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:54,780
You'd need a computer
for sure.

540
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,040
So, ten steps, well, that's
what's known.

541
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,520
There are probably
more than that.

542
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,180
It's probably more complicated
than what we really know in

543
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:06,210
terms of fishing out
intermediates.

544
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:10,460
And the basic reaction is, you
start out with an oxide of

545
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:15,290
iodine, which is clear.

546
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:22,200
You create I2, which is
going to look gold.

547
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,140
In solution, and then it creates
Ii minus, which is

548
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:29,160
going to look deep blue.

549
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,830
And then it'll feed back
and start again.

550
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:35,400
So we're going to have this
cycle of products.

551
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,250
And amongst those ten steps, or
more than ten steps, there

552
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:44,700
are a few autocatalytic steps,
which provide the feedback.

553
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:52,840
So now I have to start it.

554
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,260
Let's go ahead and read.

555
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:10,290
Alright.

556
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:11,770
So here we go.

557
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:18,660
So, there are two solutions, A
and solution C. Actually, we

558
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,420
mix three solutions together.

559
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,040
The potassium iodide is what is
going to give rise to the

560
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,300
different colors.

561
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,330
And now we're in the gold
phase of the reaction.

562
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,580
It's important to stir,
otherwise it wouldn't, and

563
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,740
then it turns deep blue.

564
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,530
And then there's an induction
period, where

565
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:37,710
you wait for a while.

566
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:43,520
And then eventually it
should go clear.

567
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,010
So it goes clear.

568
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:46,340
And then it turns gold again.

569
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,850
And then deep blue, and there's
the oscillation.

570
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,060
And then a long induction
period, and then it goes

571
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,150
through that cycle over
and over again.

572
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:57,260
And the recipe can be
found pretty easily.

573
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,570
And if you ever are in a lab,
have access to doing this,

574
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,040
it's a pretty easy reaction
to put together.

575
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:08,840
The only problem is that unless
you use fresh hydrogen

576
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,510
peroxide, it doesn't work.

577
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:14,560
Because hydrogen peroxide tends
to go bad over time.

578
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,290
If you're going to do this,
buy your hydrogen peroxide

579
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:21,070
immediately before you try
to do the experiment.

580
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,420
And then it'll work.

581
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,350
So what happens is that as
long as there is a steady

582
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:31,290
supply of hydrogen peroxide in
here, it'll keep oscillating.

583
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:34,340
But as you've used up the
hydrogen peroxide, this is

584
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,240
going to start to die.

585
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,050
And eventually it'll have
this pale blue solution.

586
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,770
And it's like the
heart stopping.

587
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,640
If you want to start it up
again, add more hydrogen

588
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:50,360
peroxide and it'll
start up again.

589
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,450
OK, any questions?

590
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,760
There's like an infinite number
of these oscillating

591
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:59,210
reactions that people
have discovered.

592
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:09,600
And optimized, that you can
find in different places.

593
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,000
Questions?

594
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,330
Questions about the final.

595
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:23,400
I didn't get to do a review,
but you'll get that

596
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,610
done with the TAs.

597
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:26,870
Yes.

598
00:39:26,870 --> 00:39:33,590
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

599
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,780
PROFESSOR: Because there's
enough of the equivalent of A,

600
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,760
of the rain here.

601
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,550
So it'll oscillate and there'll
be some damping.

602
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:45,060
So what will happen in this
reaction is that the induction

603
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:48,910
period will get longer, and
longer, and longer.

604
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:55,530
Because the w, this term right
here, the frequency which

605
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:58,590
depends on the concentration
of A, that well

606
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,600
get slower and slower.

607
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:06,910
And eventually it'll just die.

608
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,160
OK?
