8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,450
PROFESSOR: And today I'll
continue with both ideal and

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,830
non-ideal, or real,
liquid mixtures.

10
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,850
And let me just say the reason
we're in some sense lavishing

11
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,670
so much attention on this topic
is because, after all,

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:33,340
there's just an enormous amount
of chemistry that

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,690
happens in liquid mixtures.

14
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:36,070
Awful lot of biology.

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,890
Awful lot of just processing
of stuff.

16
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:40,240
Distillation and everything
else.

17
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,940
So there's so much chemistry
that takes place in liquid

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,300
mixtures that it is really
important to have a sense of

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,375
what the free energy and
chemical potential of each of

20
00:00:49,375 --> 00:00:51,110
the species is doing in there.

21
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,250
Because of course this is what
directly guides the chemistry

22
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:54,140
that happens.

23
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,970
So I just want to start by
finishing up something, a

24
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,880
couple of things, from the
topics from the last lecture.

25
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:07,140
One of them is, I derived an
expression for the lever rule.

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,900
And I just wanted to
make a little more

27
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,850
explicit the result.

28
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,650
It may not have been
completely clear.

29
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:18,750
So, I just want to
go back to that.

30
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:33,810
We had looked at what happens
if you start at some

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:39,710
particular point, labeled one,
and work your way up.

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,300
So we're raising the pressure.

33
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:47,730
So we're in the all gas
region to start.

34
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,230
All gas region of the
phase diagram.

35
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,920
This is xB and yB.

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,240
The liquid and gas mole
fractions of B. And the idea

37
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,290
is that here is our
initial value.

38
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,670
Now we're only in
the gas phase.

39
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:04,520
There is no liquid.

40
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:08,050
So this is yB of one.

41
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,460
There is no xB at this point.

42
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,360
We raise the pressure.

43
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,470
And at some point, depending on
where we end, we then look

44
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,750
to both coexistence curves to
determine the compositions of

45
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:25,400
both the liquid and
the gas phases.

46
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:32,620
So when we look out here,
at the liquid phase.

47
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,220
That gives us xB.

48
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,030
At where I labeled point two, so
there's two after we raise

49
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,450
the pressure.

50
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,530
We started at one.

51
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,670
And then over here, we look at
the gas phase coexistence

52
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:55,190
curve. so there's our yB
value at two, right?

53
00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:00,620
And I derived an expression for
the ratio of the number of

54
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,130
moles in the gas and
liquid phases.

55
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,340
Because the idea here is, let's
say you're working your

56
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,840
way up on the curve.

57
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,820
If you just barely get to the
coexistence curve, of course

58
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,230
then you could see how
much material you've

59
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,780
got in the two phases.

60
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,910
But there's very little
material still.

61
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,910
You've still got almost
everything in the gas phase

62
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,370
when you first reach here.

63
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:24,580
And as you work your way up in
pressure, you'd have more and

64
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,200
more liquid.

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,250
Of course, if you were to just
keep going, you'd get into the

66
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,340
pure liquid phase.

67
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,190
Typically, though, you might
stop somewhere in the middle

68
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,110
and have some reasonable amount
of material in both

69
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,210
phases, and you want
to find out the

70
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,930
composition in each phase.

71
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:37,560
And also, want to know
how much material

72
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,700
there is in each phase.

73
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,100
So the result that I derived
was n gas at two

74
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,620
over n liquid at two.

75
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,040
The ratio of total moles in
the gas to the liquid.

76
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:58,820
What I derived was xA of
two minus yA of one.

77
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,410
Over yA of one.

78
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:07,000
Minus yA of two, and I just want
to, in some sense, finish

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,170
up by making the obvious
substitution, which is, of

80
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,300
course these are
mole fractions.

81
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,660
So I can just write xA
is one minus xB.

82
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,540
And yA is one minus yB.

83
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,990
And I just want to put this in
the terms that are written

84
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:25,200
here in the phase diagram.

85
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,480
When I got to this result I
pointed out that therefore you

86
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,590
can use the lever rule.

87
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:33,110
And I just want to make that
a little bit more explicit.

88
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,950
So using that relation, then we
can see that ng of two over

89
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:42,360
nl of two, total number of moles
in the gas to the liquid

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,280
is, now I'm going to substitute
in to get yB of one

91
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:57,860
minus xB of two over yB of
two minus yB of one.

92
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,300
So all I've done here is
substitute in these

93
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,200
expressions.

94
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,500
And now I'm going to just
switch both of these.

95
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:10,750
And so I'm going to multiply
both sides by negative one.

96
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:19,340
So I can write xB of two minus
yB of one over yB of

97
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,980
one minus yB of two.

98
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:27,390
So that's the result
that I want.

99
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:32,160
Because if I look at the two
segments of this line, on

100
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,930
either side of the pressure
value I've reached, then what

101
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:43,050
I see, of course, is that
over here I've got xB of

102
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,590
two minus yB of one.

103
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,980
That's this.

104
00:05:49,980 --> 00:06:17,360
And this part is yB of
one minus yB of two.

105
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,450
That is, it's this part.

106
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,290
And that's here.

107
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,590
And so that's the point, is that
the ratio of moles in the

108
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:28,250
gas and liquid phases is just
given by the two segments of

109
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,420
this on either side.

110
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,510
And so what this allows us to
see very simply is alright,

111
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,320
I'm going to raise the pressure
at some point.

112
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,340
And depending on how much
material I feel like I need to

113
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,530
collect in the new phase, I
can always determine that

114
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:45,290
simply by reading off the phase
diagram what the ratio

115
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:56,710
of these two segment
lengths is.

116
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,180
Now what I want to do.

117
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:03,530
What what we've done mostly is
just go through these phase

118
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:05,630
diagrams, see how
to read them.

119
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:09,570
How to follow events on them
as you change pressure in a

120
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,610
diagram like this.

121
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,110
Or change temperature
in diagrams like I

122
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,430
also showed last time.

123
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,430
Now what I'd like to do is go a
little bit further and just

124
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,650
look at expressions for the
chemical potential and the

125
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,230
free energies.

126
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:26,410
So that we can, a little more
quantitatively, see

127
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,260
what's going on.

128
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,560
So let's just see what's
happening.

129
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:45,380
So let's look at the chemical
potentials.

130
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:51,900
In ideal liquid mixtures.

131
00:07:51,900 --> 00:08:00,730
So everything is derived from
the fact that when we have any

132
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,020
of the constituents in both
phases, the chemical potential

133
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,950
must be equal in both phases.

134
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,950
Right?

135
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:12,420
So, we can write for A, mu
A of the liquid at some

136
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:18,720
temperature and pressure must
equal chemical potential of A

137
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,010
for the gas.

138
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,150
That's the partial pressure.

139
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:31,315
So if we have an ideal gas, and
certainly if we're going

140
00:08:31,315 --> 00:08:34,450
to assume an ideal liquid
mixture, we can safely assume

141
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,680
that it's an ideal
gas above it.

142
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:44,300
Then we can write
mu A in the gas.

143
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,960
Is just mu A naught.

144
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,380
That's a function of the
temperature plus RT

145
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:56,800
log of pA over p0.

146
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,430
Nothing new here, this is just
our expression for the

147
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,560
chemical potential in the
gas, with reference

148
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,080
to a standard potential.

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,420
Usually one bar.

150
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,190
At whatever the temperature
is.

151
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:10,350
And, of course, this is how it
varies as the partial pressure

152
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,340
of A in the gas phase varies.

153
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:31,410
So then we can just write our
expression for the liquid.

154
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:38,220
At our temperature and pressure,
it's given by mu

155
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,370
naught in the gas phase.

156
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,690
Plus RT log pA over p0.

157
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,580
So it's the same thing.

158
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,610
Because I'm just taking
advantage of this equality.

159
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:52,270
But of course, this is
an obvious step,

160
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,040
having written this.

161
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,150
But is a super important step.

162
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,980
That's what allows us to do
this treatment in such a

163
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,080
straightforward way.

164
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,120
We know a lot about the
chemical potential of

165
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,230
something in the gas phase.

166
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,800
Since the gas and liquid are in
equilibrium, therefore we

167
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:24,870
know the chemical potential
in the liquid phase too.

168
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:28,870
So we can rewrite this by
recognizing that if we just go

169
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:37,100
to the limit where we only have
pure liquid A, so pure

170
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:45,680
liquid A. Well, in that case, mu
A naught or sorry, mu A in

171
00:10:45,680 --> 00:11:00,400
the liquid phase, mu A star is
mu A naught in the gas phase.

172
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:08,880
Plus RT log pA over p0.

173
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,750
And so for the mixture, now all
I'm going to do is just

174
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:19,040
add and subtract terms.

175
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,450
So we can write mu A in the
liquid at T and p, right?

176
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,560
So this is in the case of the
limit of the pure liquid.

177
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,030
Now we're going to
the mixture.

178
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:48,930
So it's just mu A naught plus
RT log pA star over p0 minus

179
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:54,230
RT log of pA star over p0.

180
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:03,610
Wait a minute, lost a term.

181
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:12,690
Plus RT log pA over p0.

182
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,670
And all I want to do now
is combine terms.

183
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:22,740
To write mu A star liquid
temperature and pressure.

184
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:30,730
Plus RT log of pA
over pA star.

185
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,900
So this is a very convenient
form for it.

186
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:40,570
And then, of course, we have an
expression for pA, right?

187
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:49,440
From Raoult's law. pA
is just the mole

188
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,870
fraction xA times pA star.

189
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,880
That's just true for
the ideal mixture.

190
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:08,320
So now, finally, we can write
that mu A in the liquid at T

191
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:16,220
and p is just given
by mu A star.

192
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,400
So that's for the pure
liquid at that

193
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,530
temperature and pressure.

194
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:25,970
Plus RT log of the mole fraction
of A. So that's a

195
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:33,240
very simple expression for the
chemical potential of A. And

196
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,000
of course the analogous
expression will hold for any

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,120
of the constituents.

198
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,700
In an ideal liquid mixture.

199
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,850
By the way, it's convenient
because it looks just like the

200
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:51,000
chemical potential in a mixture
of ideal gases.

201
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,210
Except that we have liquid
instead of gases, right?

202
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:03,100
Now, of course, since this is
a mole fraction, it's always

203
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,180
between zero and one.

204
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:09,870
That means this is always
a negative number.

205
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:16,090
So what that means is that the
chemical potential in the

206
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:21,190
solution is always lower than
the chemical potential of the

207
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:57,650
pure liquid.

208
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,430
Very important result.

209
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,910
So it has all sorts of
implications that we'll see.

210
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,860
One of them is osmotic
pressure.

211
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:11,050
It means that if I have a
biological cell, or some

212
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,240
container with a membrane
through which one of the

213
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,520
constituents might pass.

214
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,230
So in other words, the let's
say, component A, maybe it's

215
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,930
just water.

216
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:25,520
It can pass freely, let's say,
from the outside to the inside

217
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,040
of the cell, or from one side
to another of a membrane.

218
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,570
And on one side I've just
got pure water.

219
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,340
And on the other I've got saline
solution or whatever is

220
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,650
in the cells, right?

221
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,130
What's the water going to
do in that situation?

222
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,710
What's going to happen?

223
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,970
Anybody know?

224
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,380
So I've got, I just take fresh
cells and plunk them into pure

225
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,330
water solution.

226
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:56,510
What happens?

227
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:56,730
Yeah.

228
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,020
They burst.

229
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,610
Water rushes in.

230
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,720
Because the chemical potential
is lower inside.

231
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,260
It's always lower in solution
than outside.

232
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,490
So water rushes in, and
the membrane expands.

233
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,800
Now, if the membrane is
strong enough, at some

234
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,300
point it may not burst.

235
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,560
And the pressure might
start to go up.

236
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,400
Let's say the membrane
is strong enough to

237
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,260
resist and not burst.

238
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:26,190
Eventually, the water won't keep
going in indefinitely.

239
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:30,040
That's because it won't be at
the same temperature and

240
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,730
pressure any more.

241
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,510
In particular, the pressure
will have changed.

242
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,990
So you can build up some high
pressure, what's called

243
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:38,620
osmotic pressure.

244
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,540
Because of the fact that at the
same pressure the chemical

245
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:45,730
potential of the water's lower
inside the cell or inside the

246
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,780
enclosure with the membrane.

247
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,140
So water will keep filling.

248
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,170
And at some point the chemical
potentials will equalize

249
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,880
because of the change
in pressure.

250
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,440
And at that point there'll be
an equilibrium established.

251
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,990
We'll see that quantitatively
a little bit later.

252
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,630
OK.

253
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:13,160
The other thing to notice is,
this is familiar from the

254
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,820
expression for a gas mixture.

255
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,850
What drives the gas mixture?

256
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:21,840
Remember back when we discussed
mixing of gases and

257
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,220
the fact that they
would mix at all.

258
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,450
What makes that happen?

259
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:28,070
What's driving it?

260
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,050
Yeah, it's entropy, right?

261
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,580
And that's what's happening
here too.

262
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,030
Of course, in the case of the
ideal liquid mixture, there's

263
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,070
no energetic interaction.

264
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:40,440
The molecules are
non-interacting in this case.

265
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,220
But of course, entropy is going
to want them to mix.

266
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,950
And that's what's
resulting in the

267
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:50,070
decrease in chemical potential.

268
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,440
Let's see that a little more
explicitly by just calculating

269
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,610
out the free energy
change of mixing.

270
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:02,510
So, delta G of mixing.

271
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:15,580
So we're going to start with
two separated liquids.

272
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,050
And then we'll remove
the barrier.

273
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:26,940
And we'll have the two
mixed together.

274
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,900
So of course, the free energy in
either case is just the sum

275
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,670
of the number of moles of
each times the chemical

276
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:35,710
potential of each.

277
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,910
We have expressions for that.

278
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,160
So starting G1 in this case.

279
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,030
It's n of A, number of
moles of A. Times

280
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:49,930
the chemical potential.

281
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:58,780
So it's xA mu A star
in the liquid.

282
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:08,830
Plus nB xB B mu B star
of the liquid.

283
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:12,300
Here, G of two.

284
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,590
After we let them mix.

285
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,270
Then it's n -- wait a minute.

286
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:26,110
It's just n.

287
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:29,220
I think I've got that wrong
in the notes also.

288
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,860
Right, it's just a number of
moles times the chemical

289
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,410
potential in each case.

290
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,880
So it's the number of
moles times xA.

291
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:43,600
Times mu A in the mixture.

292
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:52,660
Plus n xB mu B in the mixture.

293
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,620
But we've just figured it out
our expressions for mu A and

294
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:58,930
mu B, our chemical potentials
of each constituent in the

295
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:02,040
ideal liquid mixture.

296
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:11,690
So this is just n xA.

297
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,940
And here's our expression.

298
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,250
And of course these are
going to cancel.

299
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,780
Let's write it out.

300
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:27,910
So it's mu A star
plus RT log xA.

301
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:37,820
And then, mu B star
plus RT log xB.

302
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,890
So our delta G of mixing
is just the difference

303
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,670
between these two.

304
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:58,730
So it's n RT xA log
xA plus xB log xB.

305
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:03,570
Where have you seen
that before?

306
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:03,720
Yeah.

307
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,710
The same thing that you had for
the delta G of mixing for

308
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,330
an ideal gas mixture.

309
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,700
Why?

310
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,890
Because we're not accounting for
any interactions between

311
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,640
the molecules in either
of the phases.

312
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:22,690
And if the molecules aren't
interacting, it's all entropy.

313
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,770
And the entropy term has the
same form in either case.

314
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:29,780
In microscopic terms, it's just
measuring the fact that

315
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,460
there's more disorder
in the mixture

316
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,860
than in the pure liquids.

317
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:45,955
Just the same it was
in the gas phase.

318
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:49,710
OK.

319
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,490
We can see this even more
explicitly if we just recall

320
00:21:55,490 --> 00:22:00,980
that G is V dp minus S dT.

321
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,710
So we can just explicitly
calculate

322
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:05,060
the entropy of mixing.

323
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:13,110
Delta S of mixing is just the
partial of delta G of mixing.

324
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,360
Negative partial.

325
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,130
With respect to temperature.

326
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,700
At constant pressure.

327
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:30,180
So it's just minus n R xA
log xA plus xB log xB.

328
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,930
So that's our entropy
of mixing.

329
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:41,470
We can calculate our
enthalpy of mixing.

330
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:44,550
Just delta G of mixing.

331
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:48,380
Plus T delta S of mixing.

332
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,630
But it's immediately apparent
that these are just going to

333
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:53,630
cancel when we multiply
this by T. So there's

334
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,970
no enthalpy of mixing.

335
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,220
Just as we expect when
there are no

336
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,560
energetic terms involved.

337
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:06,170
It's all entropy that's
driving the mixture.

338
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,320
One more detail, it's
straightforward to see that

339
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,120
there's no volume change.

340
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,320
That is, if we take the
derivative of delta G of

341
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,210
mixing the partial derivative
with respect to pressure, at

342
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,840
constant temperature, of course,
there's no explicit

343
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,820
pressure dependence.

344
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,870
This is zero.

345
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,820
So again, in the ideal liquid
mixture case, their molecules

346
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,580
aren't interacting.

347
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:36,460
So there's no reason, when I
open that barrier, that the

348
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:46,640
amount of volume they occupy
altogether is going to change.

349
00:23:46,640 --> 00:24:00,130
Any questions, so far?

350
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,110
OK.

351
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:26,150
Then, let's move on to
non-ideal solutions.

352
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:30,190
By the way, just to return
briefly to this topic of

353
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:34,050
osmotic pressure, I just want
to emphasize that result

354
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:36,950
didn't need any kind of energy
of mixing, either, right?

355
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:39,850
Just from the entropy
term you would burst

356
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,060
the cell or do whatever.

357
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,710
You end up with a
larger pressure.

358
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:55,300
So in other words, if you have
a situation where, here is A,

359
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,650
pure liquid.

360
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:07,740
And here is A plus B liquid, so
mu A star is greater than

361
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,610
mu A. We know that in all cases
at the same pressure,

362
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,480
the chemical potential of the
mixture is lower than the

363
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,230
chemical potential of
the pure liquid.

364
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,600
What's going to happen?

365
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,980
Well, A is going to, oh,
sorry, A over here is

366
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,240
going to rush in.

367
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,970
It's going to get through
this, if I've got a

368
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,800
semi-permeable membrane, it's
permeable to A but not to B.

369
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,240
Common situation, of course.

370
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,440
That's certainly the case
for the cell membrane.

371
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:42,080
Water may flow easily in through
the membrane, but all

372
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,590
of the stuff, all the salt and
everything else that's inside

373
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,320
the cell generally won't.

374
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,400
So of course A then flows
through this, what's called a

375
00:25:52,400 --> 00:26:01,980
semi-permeable membrane.

376
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:09,450
And you'll wind up with either a
burst membrane, or something

377
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,390
that looks like this.

378
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:18,170
Where now there is additional
pressure here.

379
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,270
And you'll have some different
mole fraction than you started

380
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:29,220
with before.

381
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:54,650
Now let's go over to non-ideal
solutions.

382
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:58,760
So let's just think
microscopically for a moment

383
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,720
about how this is
going to work.

384
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,320
You know, normally, always,
there are interactions between

385
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,730
the molecules and the liquid.

386
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:08,120
The liquid is a condensed
phase.

387
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,520
The molecules are in immediate
proximity to each other.

388
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,250
So it's very different from the
gas phase, where it can be

389
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,330
a pretty realistic approximation
to say, well,

390
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,750
the molecules are essentially
non-interacting.

391
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:22,120
The ideal gas law may turn
out to be a very good

392
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,080
approximation.

393
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,930
In the liquid, really, it's
never the case that you don't

394
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,650
have interactions.

395
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:43,770
So if we just sketch that.

396
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:50,890
If we start with a bunch of
molecules in A, they're

397
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,160
interacting.

398
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:58,780
So there's some interaction
energy.

399
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,630
I'll call it AA, it's the
interaction between two

400
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:09,630
molecules of A. In most cases
it'll be less than zero.

401
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:13,350
That is, there'd be
a weak attraction.

402
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:26,120
Same thing between
molecules of B.

403
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:29,620
So that's my situation in
the separated liquids.

404
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,020
I've got molecules in
each container.

405
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,850
They're interacting.

406
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,530
There's some energy associated
with that.

407
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:50,490
So here's the pure separated
liquids.

408
00:28:50,490 --> 00:28:53,850
And now, I'll open up
the barrier and

409
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,820
let the liquids mix.

410
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,430
And now suddenly, of course, A
and B are going to interact

411
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:00,320
with each other as well
as other molecules

412
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,470
of their own kind.

413
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:11,040
So now, suddenly, there's going
to be some interaction

414
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,440
energy. uAB.

415
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,240
And very simplistically, we can
envision that for some of

416
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,470
the molecules, essentially,
there would be

417
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,230
exchange of this sort.

418
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:44,390
So, one neighbor of this
molecule and one neighbor of

419
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:47,640
this molecule will wind up
exchanged for some pairs of

420
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,440
molecules with the
unlike species.

421
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,000
And essentially, likes
interactions will be replaced

422
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,780
by unlike interactions.

423
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,680
So there's some now change
in energy involved.

424
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,250
There's a delta u.

425
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:15,590
And as outlined in this simple
picture, it's just 2 uAB minus

426
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:18,230
uAA plus uBB.

427
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:26,910
Real liquids are very
complicated.

428
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:31,140
For liquids with relatively
simple non-directional

429
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,000
interactions, things like
organic liquids that might

430
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,900
interact van der Waal's
interactions.

431
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,630
This might be a reasonable
starting point.

432
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:46,440
And in general, if we're going
to deal with relatively small

433
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,320
deviations from the ideal liquid
mixture, the ideal

434
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,250
solution, then we can start
with a model like this.

435
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,800
And this difference is what's
going to determine how far the

436
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,950
liquid mixture will deviate from
the ideal solution case.

437
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,380
Of course, we could always just
write a term like this.

438
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,920
It may or may not be easily
expressed in this sort of way.

439
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,020
So let's just think about what
the possibilities are.

440
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,010
Of course, simply,
there are two.

441
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:21,090
The sign could be positive
or negative.

442
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,270
And what that means is, you
could have situations where

443
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:28,680
it's positive because basically
there's an energy of

444
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,310
mixing now in these cases.

445
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:35,320
If that's not zero, unlike the
ideal case, now unlike before,

446
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,560
where we just had entropy
driving the mixture, now

447
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,870
there's an energy of mixing.

448
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,180
Could be positive or negative.

449
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,260
If it's positive, that means
energetically speaking, the

450
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,210
mixture is unfavorable.

451
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,080
In other words, the
intermolecular interactions

452
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,650
between like molecules are
more favorable then the

453
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:02,290
interactions between the unlike

454
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:11,350
molecules, in that case.

455
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:25,430
So, delta u is greater
than zero.

456
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:34,680
And our delta H of mixing
is going to be close

457
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,880
to delta u of mixing.

458
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,640
That is, we're going to figure
that delta pV is not going to

459
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,070
be something large.

460
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:52,020
And in that case, we can say
delta G of mixing is 1/4 n.

461
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,180
And that's only because there
are 4 species involved here.

462
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,380
Times delta u.

463
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,120
In other words, I'm
multiplying this

464
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,360
molecular delta u.

465
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,870
This is the change in
energy for this

466
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,050
collection of four molecules.

467
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,760
Or of four molecular pairs.

468
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,690
Plus the other stuff that we've
seen for the ideal case.

469
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:20,270
That is, the entropy term, of
course, is still there. xA log

470
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:29,500
xA plus xB log xB.

471
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:33,820
And because we're treating the
case where this is positive,

472
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:47,730
that means this is bigger than
in the ideal solution case.

473
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:50,270
So of course there are lots of
examples of each of these.

474
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,570
In fact, this is the more
common deviation.

475
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,630
So, and lots of examples.

476
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,820
An easy one is acetone.

477
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,960
And carbon disulfide.

478
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:09,920
So, if we look at that, and
just see what the phase

479
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:38,940
diagram is going to look like,
it's the following.

480
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:43,670
So let's start with
the ideal case.

481
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:47,090
So I'm going to make B the
more volatile component.

482
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,560
That is, B is going to be CS2.

483
00:34:49,560 --> 00:35:00,110
So here's p star CS2, which
I'll call p star B. And

484
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:11,470
somewhere down here will be p
star for A, that is, p star

485
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,400
for acetone.

486
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,100
And this is going to be the
mole fraction of CS2.

487
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,870
Or xB.

488
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:29,660
So let's start with
the ideal case.

489
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,760
Not steep enough.

490
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:33,680
Pretty good.

491
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:45,630
OK.

492
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,110
And now let's look at
what's going to

493
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:49,510
happen in the real mixture.

494
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,140
Well, because we've got a
positive deviation, what's

495
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:58,790
going to happen is the mixing
is unfavorable.

496
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,630
The molecules aren't
that happy any more

497
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,960
about being in solution.

498
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,250
So what that means is,
relative to the ideal

499
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:09,520
solution, they'd rather go
up into the gas phase.

500
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,610
They don't like being
in the mixture.

501
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:16,900
Compared to what they would feel
in the ideal solution,

502
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:17,930
where there are no
interactions.

503
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:20,310
Because the interactions between
unlike molecules are

504
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,850
unfavorable.

505
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:27,540
So what's going to
happen, then, is

506
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:33,510
the pressure is higher.

507
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:36,550
You have deviations from
the ideal case,

508
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:38,300
in the total pressure.

509
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:53,790
And in each of the individual
partial pressures.

510
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:58,400
That's the total pressure.
pA plus pB.

511
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,000
In the ideal case it's
this straight line.

512
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:06,340
In the non-ideal case, though,
it's bigger than

513
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,900
the straight line.

514
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,120
Because more stuff wants to
get up into the gas phase.

515
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:12,930
And it's the same for each
individual component.

516
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:18,720
So here's pA.

517
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,230
And there's pB.

518
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,700
Any questions?

519
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,440
OK, so it's obvious just from
looking at this that each of

520
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,870
the partial pressures
is bigger than it is

521
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,300
in the ideal case.

522
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,490
And so, so is the
total pressure.

523
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:46,910
So in other words, if I say
what's the partial pressure of

524
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:50,520
CS2, well, since it's not the
simple ideal case, actually I

525
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,990
don't know what it
is in general.

526
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:55,260
It's not easy to calculate a
priori what it's going to do

527
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,940
all the way across the phase
diagram for any mole fraction.

528
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,510
What I do know, though, is it's
bigger than it would be

529
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,950
for the ideal solution case.

530
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:11,530
In other words, it's bigger than
x CS2 times p star CS2,

531
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:15,580
the pressure over the
pure liquid CS2.

532
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,650
Same for acetone.

533
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:29,280
It's bigger than x acetone
p star acetone.

534
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,090
And since both partial pressures
are bigger, the

535
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,260
total pressure has
to be bigger.

536
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,770
And of course, that's something
you can read right

537
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,420
off the diagram as well.

538
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:49,390
In other words, the total
pressure is bigger than in the

539
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:55,710
ideal solution case.

540
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,320
Any questions?

541
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,460
OK.

542
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,115
So the negative case,
of course,

543
00:39:05,115 --> 00:39:07,390
is exactly the opposite.

544
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:17,440
So I'll just go through
it quickly.

545
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,240
So, remember positive deviations
came, let's put

546
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:27,090
this back up there.

547
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,690
That came from the case where
the unlike intermolecular

548
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:34,180
interactions are not
as favorable.

549
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,710
There's less attraction, more
repulsion than in this case.

550
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,250
Of course, there are plenty of
cases of the opposite sort.

551
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:44,270
Where the unlike intermolecular
interactions

552
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,290
are attractive.

553
00:39:45,290 --> 00:39:50,340
More than the interactions
between like molecules.

554
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:54,570
And in that case, you have
the opposite result.

555
00:39:54,570 --> 00:40:05,620
So you can have negative
deviations.

556
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:09,920
In other words, delta
u is less than zero.

557
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,970
Lots of examples.

558
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:13,500
I've got one in the notes,
it's just acetone and

559
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,920
chloroform.

560
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:22,020
So if we get rid of the carbon
disulfide and put CHCl3 in

561
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,020
there, that's more favorable.

562
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,030
Because there's weak
hydrogen bonding

563
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:29,140
between the unlike species.

564
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,450
And not between the
like species.

565
00:40:31,450 --> 00:40:39,460
So what happens is, you have
acetone, it's this.

566
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:47,500
And you have chloroform.

567
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,340
And there's weak hydrogen
bonding between them.

568
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,690
There's an attraction there.

569
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,820
That doesn't exist
between either

570
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,610
case of the like molecules.

571
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:03,570
So now there's stronger
attraction between them than

572
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,870
there is between molecules
in either of

573
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,840
the pure liquid cases.

574
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,240
So, of course, you know
that the opposite

575
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,600
result is going to happen.

576
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:18,010
In this case, now you mix them
together, relative to the

577
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,555
ideal solution where there are
no interactions, now they want

578
00:41:21,555 --> 00:41:22,900
to be together.

579
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:27,470
They're clinging to each other
through these hydrogen bonds.

580
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:30,890
What's that mean for the
pressure up in the gas phase,

581
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,950
in the solution?

582
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,440
They don't want to go
there any more.

583
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,880
Stuff in the gas phase now wants
to condense down into

584
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,340
the liquid.

585
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:43,600
Because there they have
favorable interactions.

586
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,650
So that's, of course,
what'll happen.

587
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,280
And so then you just see the
opposite sort of deviation

588
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:56,120
from what I just illustrated
before.

589
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:08,320
So then if we look at
p star CHCl3, where

590
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,820
are these lines going?

591
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:18,760
Well, may have been
more artistic.

592
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:27,710
But I'm afraid I'm going to
have to go with reality.

593
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,670
p star for acetone.

594
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:35,330
There's chloroform.

595
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,360
And now our deviation
is going to be in

596
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,610
the opposite direction.

597
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,880
So all the, both of the partial
pressures and the

598
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:55,840
total pressure are going to go
lower than indicated here.

599
00:42:55,840 --> 00:43:03,180
So p total is now less than,
for the real case, is less

600
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:11,460
than p total for
the ideal case.

601
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:14,090
In the situation where you have
attractive interactions

602
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:17,110
between the unlike molecules.

603
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,860
Any questions?

604
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,650
OK.

605
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,780
Now, in general, this
is complicated.

606
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:30,190
To describe quantitatively
throughout the

607
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:33,100
entire phase diagram.

608
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:36,430
The interactions are
complicated.

609
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:38,480
Lots of times, molecules
interact with

610
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,750
more than one neighbor.

611
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:45,770
So in general, we don't have a
simple analytical expression

612
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:49,950
for what the pressure is going
to do as a function of mole

613
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,230
fraction all the way
from zero to one.

614
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,380
Of course, we have it
in very simple form

615
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,960
for the ideal solution.

616
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:58,940
Because everything's linear.

617
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,700
So it's very simple.

618
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,510
These are replaced by equalities
and we know

619
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,060
everything.

620
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,550
Now we don't.

621
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,520
But we can at least make some
progress by looking at the

622
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,080
limiting cases.

623
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,730
Where you have just very
dilute solutions.

624
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:17,160
So in that case, you
can anticipate

625
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:18,030
what's going to happen.

626
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:24,730
So let's say we mix A and B.
And one of them is in very

627
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,740
dilute concentration.

628
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:32,010
For the other one, for B, most
molecules of B are just going

629
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,200
to see themselves.

630
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,980
They hardly know that
you've mixed any

631
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,840
molecules of A in there.

632
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:42,570
For them, it's pretty much
an ideal solution.

633
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:44,090
They think they're in
an ideal solution.

634
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:47,860
Which is to say there's an
entropy change in mixing.

635
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,400
But hardly any of them
experience interactions with

636
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,830
the unlike molecules.

637
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,850
For the dilute molecules,
there is a change.

638
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:01,690
You can't use Raoult's
law any more.

639
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:06,470
But at least we can look of
the slope of the curve and

640
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:09,580
say, OK, at least in the dilute
solution case for a

641
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,620
little while it's going
to be linear.

642
00:45:11,620 --> 00:45:13,930
We can understand it.

643
00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:16,950
We can tabulate it.

644
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:41,920
So let's look at
how that works.

645
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,310
Alright.

646
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:46,300
That limit is something that has
a name, that's called the

647
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,860
ideal dilute solution.

648
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,810
Not to be confused with
the ideal solution.

649
00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:53,840
Where both constituents
follow Raoult's law,

650
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,490
as we've seen before.

651
00:45:55,490 --> 00:46:07,010
So ideal dilute solution.

652
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,440
We're going to just look
at these limits.

653
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:17,360
So, if we start with the ideal
case, so let's imagine we're

654
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:22,510
going to look at carbon
disulfide again.

655
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:32,860
Here's p star CS2, which
is our pB star.

656
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:36,870
And this is x CS2, or xB.

657
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:49,340
OK, well, what happens
if we've got

658
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:53,980
almost pure carbon disulfide.

659
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,520
Well, what's going to happen is
in this limit, like I was

660
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,910
mentioning, up here the CS2
pretty much sees other CS2.

661
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:06,770
It thinks it's in an
ideal solution.

662
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:11,130
It's going to look like that.

663
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:15,920
Now, let's go to the
other limit.

664
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:30,320
So this is the limit x CS2
equals xB approaches one.

665
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,250
Raoult's law.

666
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:38,070
Two, the other limit. x
CS2 approaches zero.

667
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:39,920
We're down here.

668
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:43,270
So it's definitely not
going to be the same.

669
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:47,300
Because now, every molecule,
every CS2 molecule, is

670
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,890
completely surrounded
by acetone.

671
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:54,250
So they all feel the
energy of mixing.

672
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,620
Because there are hardly
any of them there.

673
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,520
So every one of them is, it's
very rare for one to find a

674
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:00,870
neighbor of its own kind.

675
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:03,820
And this is a case where there's
a positive deviation

676
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,550
from ideality.

677
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:07,730
That is, the interactions
are less favorable

678
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:09,940
between unlike species.

679
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,120
So, it's up here.

680
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,990
Doesn't like that.

681
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:18,190
It says, get me out here, I'd
much rather be in the gas

682
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:22,970
phase, compared to the ideal
case, then surrounded by all

683
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,470
these acetone molecules,
right?

684
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,520
So that's what'll happen.

685
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:35,050
And now it's up to the artist.

686
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:39,080
But in some way there's
going to be a set

687
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,610
of values in between.

688
00:48:41,610 --> 00:48:44,910
And the ideal dilute solution by
itself isn't going to tell

689
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:45,850
us about that.

690
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,970
It's telling us about
the two limits.

691
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:51,100
Now, if we follow this,
and I can see I'm

692
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,650
going to be in trouble.

693
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:58,200
But I can do a little creative
bending of the line here.

694
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,350
If I follow this slope
up to here,

695
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,660
it'll intercept somewhere.

696
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:04,650
That has a name.

697
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,620
It's called the Henry's
law constant.

698
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:10,020
I can write it as
K CS2, or KB.

699
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:18,910
So the point is, that at
least for some range of

700
00:49:18,910 --> 00:49:21,380
concentrations, the variation
is linear.

701
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,060
And what that means is, if
I know this Henry's law

702
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:32,160
constant, for CS2 mixed with
acetone specifically, it would

703
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:32,690
be different.

704
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:34,050
If it's mixed with something
else, right?

705
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,750
Other kinds of interactions with
different energies will

706
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,700
have a different slope.

707
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:41,190
But if I know that number,
it's still useful.

708
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:47,260
Because at least for that pair
of constituents, I know the

709
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,450
dependents for some range
of concentrations.

710
00:49:52,450 --> 00:50:02,000
So this is Henry's
law. p CS --

711
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:15,720
Oops, CS2 is x CS2
times K CS2.

712
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:27,690
Not quite as convenient
as Raoult's law.

713
00:50:27,690 --> 00:50:30,010
That number, I don't need
to know what the other

714
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:31,660
constituent is.

715
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:33,010
It's just a property of CS2.

716
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:36,780
It depends on the temperature,
but not the other member of

717
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,510
the mixture.

718
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:42,300
This one does, but still there's
at least a substantial

719
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,890
number of these things
tabulated.

720
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:46,650
Especially for important
mixtures.

721
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:49,540
So it becomes useful for
dilute solutions.

722
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,150
And there's an awful
lot of chemistry.

723
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,330
There's an awful lot of biology
that happens in

724
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,190
relatively dilute solutions.

725
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:02,390
OK.

726
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:04,060
I'll leave it at this point.

727
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,980
Next time we'll look at the
total phase diagram, just like

728
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,330
we did last time looking at
both the liquid and gas

729
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:13,450
coexistence curves, and seeing
what the behavior is as a

730
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:15,120
function of mole fractions.

731
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,580
And we'll talk about
distillation and so forth in

732
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,840
non-ideal liquids.
