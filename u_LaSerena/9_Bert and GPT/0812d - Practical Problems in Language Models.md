- We need general data sets from different sources

## How use BERT
It's already trained; it's expensive 3000USD and creates pollution, so we don't keep training it
- Pretraining with general data set
	- Fine tuning with some freeze weights
- Attatch on top of this fine tuned BERT we put a new Neural Network
